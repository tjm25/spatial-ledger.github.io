Recognizing this gap, Middlesbrough Council has prepared a new Local Plan; a Publication Draft was issued in March 2025. This new plan will provide an integrated strategy for housing, economic development (including regenerating the town centre and Middlehaven), and environmental protection through to 2040. The lack of a recent plan has made it challenging for Middlesbrough to resist less sustainable proposals, although as an urban area it has generally directed development to brownfield land. With the 2014 plan out-of-date, the tilted balance can apply, but Middlesbrough has had modest housing delivery which somewhat limited speculative interest. The forthcoming plan, once adopted (likely 2025/26), will modernize the policy framework and give the council stronger grounds to guide and approve developments in line with local priorities.",

The examination of the plan is ongoing amid some local opposition to the high growth. In the interim, the 2018 plan is just past five years old, meaning Mid Sussex’s policies could be considered out-of-date if the review stalls.

Until adoption, the 2015 joint plan and saved local policies still apply, but Newcastle’s housing need has risen since 2015, and some allocations in the old plan have lagged in delivery. This has put pressure on land supply and seen the tilted balance raised in a few appeals, though Newcastle has so far managed to direct most development to plan-compliant sites.

The tilted balance has been applied in various appeals, leading to unplanned permissions.

    "notes": "North Lincolnshire’s current development plan consists of an adopted 2011 Core Strategy and saved policies from a 2003 Local Plan. These are significantly out-of-date. The council had been preparing a comprehensive new Local Plan to cover 2017–2038, and it reached submission in 2022. However, the examination raised concerns (including likely underestimation of housing need and infrastructure deliverability), and in October 2024 North Lincolnshire formally withdrew the emerging Local Plan. This leaves the authority without an up-to-date plan. The policy vacuum means development proposals are largely assessed against the NPPF; indeed, North Lincolnshire has seen the tilted balance engaged frequently, given difficulties in demonstrating a five-year housing supply. The area has notable development pressures around Scunthorpe and along the Humber (including renewable energy projects). The council will need to restart the plan process, incorporating the Inspector’s feedback, but until a new plan is adopted, North Lincolnshire remains at high risk of unplanned, appeal-led development due to its outdated policy framework.",

This emerging plan focuses growth in towns like North Walsham, Fakenham, and Holt, while limiting development in sensitive coastal and countryside areas. During the long gap without an updated plan, North Norfolk has faced some development pressure, though the constraint of protected landscapes has somewhat dampened speculative proposals. Nonetheless, the lack of a five-year supply in recent years has triggered the tilted balance for certain inland sites. The new plan’s adoption (expected in 2024) will supersede the 2008/11 documents, provide updated allocations (including a major urban extension in North Walsham), and strengthen the council’s hand in managing development consistent with environmental constraints.",

To move forward, the council is working on a new North Northamptonshire Strategic Plan that will extend the horizon likely to 2041 and update housing and employment targets in line with the area’s growth ambitions and Oxford-Cambridge Arc context. Until this is adopted, the 2016 JCS is the main policy document; it’s becoming out-of-date, though many of its urban extensions are still being built out.

The council worked on a new Local Plan 2023-2038 and had reached a publication draft in 2022, proposing significant growth including a new garden village at Banwell. However, in 2023 the council paused this plan amid concerns about the evidence and changes in political leadership. A revised Local Plan 2039 was published in Nov 2023 for consultation, now focusing more on brownfield and sustainable locations, but still not submitted. Consequently, North Somerset remains without an up-to-date plan. The district has acute housing pressures from Bristol’s overspill, and without a new plan, it risks speculative applications. The council has struggled with demonstrating a five-year supply, invoking the tilted balance in several appeals. Securing adoption of the new plan (now likely in 2025) is essential to direct large developments (like at Weston-super-Mare and Nailsea) coherently and protect less suitable areas until at least 2039.",

However, to ensure policies (especially around affordable housing and infrastructure) keep pace with changing needs, a plan update will likely commence by late 2025.

The plan allocates major housing growth around towns like Atherstone, Polesworth/Dordon, and Coleshill, aiming to deliver about 5,300 homes (2014–2033) which is a sizable uplift for this largely rural area. As it stands, the plan is recent and provides an NPPF-compliant framework. The borough is working to facilitate the delivery of allocations like the large site at Dordon (several thousand homes) and employment expansions tied to the M42 corridor. With the plan in place, North Warwickshire maintains a five-year supply and thus decisions remain firmly plan-led; the tilted balance is not generally an issue. The council will need to monitor the plan’s delivery trajectory closely given the reliance on a few big sites. A review will likely be needed by 2026 to roll the plan forward beyond 2033 and adjust for any changes in regional growth strategies (e.g., the Birmingham & Black Country housing shortfalls).",

    "notes": "North Yorkshire Council became a unitary authority in April 2023, merging seven districts (Hambleton, Harrogate, Richmondshire, Ryedale, Scarborough, Selby, plus the County Council). Currently, planning decisions rely on the existing Local Plans of the former districts, which vary in age: Harrogate’s plan (adopted 2020) and Craven’s (2019) are relatively recent, while others like Selby (Core Strategy 2013), Richmondshire (2014) and Ryedale (2013) are older, and Scarborough’s plan dates to 2017. These disparate plans have differing policies and timeframes. North Yorkshire Council has launched work on a new North Yorkshire Local Plan, which will provide a unified strategy for development across England’s largest county. This process is in early stages (a call for sites and initial consultations in 2023/24) and adoption is likely years away. In the interim, there is a policy vacuum at the strategic level: for example, how to allocate housing need that was unmet in some districts or address county-wide infrastructure. The NPPF’s tilted balance could apply in parts of North Yorkshire where the old plans are out-of-date or where five-year supply is lacking (which has been the case in Selby and Hambleton recently). The new council is managing these risks by honoring commitments in approved plans and carefully assessing applications against the NPPF. However, the sooner a comprehensive plan is in place (anticipated by 2027–2028), the better the authority can guide sustainable growth and protect its environment coherently across the whole county.",

Adoption of the GNSP, expected around 2025, will firm up targets (likely increasing housing numbers for the city) and allocate broad locations (such as around the proposed HS2 East Midlands Hub at Toton just outside the city) that impact Nottingham. Until then, Nottingham relies on its 2014/2020 plans and the NPPF; crucially, it benefits from the urban focus of national policy and its demonstrated urban housing supply, which has so far averted major speculative development issues.",

    "notes": "Oadby and Wigston, a compact urban borough south of Leicester, adopted its Local Plan in April 2019. That plan, running to 2031, allocated limited growth (around 2,000 homes) mostly on brownfield and a few Greenfield edge sites, given the borough’s tight boundaries and surrounding Green Belt. With the plan now over five years old, the council has been working on a new Local Plan 2021-2041, which reached Regulation 19 Publication in January 2025. This new plan must reckon with a substantial increase in housing need figures (partly due to Leicester City’s unmet need). Likely, it will need to identify one or more sustainable urban extensions possibly spilling into current Green Belt. As of 2025, the 2019 plan’s allocations are largely built or committed, and Oadby & Wigston has struggled to maintain a five-year supply (it has leaned on Leicester’s unmet need agreement to buffer this). The tilted balance has been a concern recently, with developers eyeing Greenfield land. Adoption of the new plan (expected by 2025/26) is crucial to provide new allocations (potentially a major urban extension west of Oadby) and updated policies. In the interim, the borough’s decisions rely on the aging 2019 plan and the broader Leicestershire housing distribution agreements. The sooner the new plan is in place, the sooner Oadby & Wigston can firm up its stance against speculative proposals and plan comprehensively for infrastructure alongside growth.",

    "notes": "Oldham MBC, as part of Greater Manchester, benefitted from the adoption of the Places for Everyone (PfE) joint plan in March 2024. PfE allocates several significant sites in Oldham previously in Green Belt – notably around Elton Reservoir (shared with Bury) and at Broadbent Moss – to deliver new housing and employment through to 2037, in addition to urban brownfield development. This joint plan supplants the strategic elements of Oldham’s old plan. Oldham’s own Local Plan documents (dating back to a 2011 Development Plan Document) will be updated in light of PfE, but for strategic matters, the borough now has an up-to-date framework. With PfE, Oldham can meet its housing requirement (incl. some contribution to GM-wide need) and plan necessary infrastructure like transport links to new sites. The plan’s adoption ensures no authority in the PfE partnership is subject to tilted balance due to plan absence. Oldham will still likely produce a new local plan or core strategy to align local policies with PfE in coming years, but in the meantime, PfE plus Oldham’s existing control policies allow the council to manage development effectively. This significantly reduces speculative development risk on formerly protected land since clear allocations and boundaries are now set.",

This plan sets out an ambitious regeneration blueprint to 2038 for the area surrounding the forthcoming HS2 and Crossrail hub at Old Oak Common, aiming to deliver 25,500 new homes and 56,000 jobs.

It establishes detailed place policies for districts like Old Oak South, North Acton, and the Park Royal industrial estate. With adoption, OPDC has been actively determining large applications (several thousand homes have permission in the area). The plan’s currency means the OPDC can drive development according to its strategy – for example, securing affordable housing and new parks – without the threat of developers bypassing the plan. Given its end date (2038) and relatively recent adoption, no review is yet needed. Eventually, once the area’s development is well underway (post-HS2 opening around 2030), a mid-life review may occur, but for now the focus is implementation.

As of 2025, however, the JLP’s strategy remains effective: Plymouth has a rolling pipeline of housing, and recent monitoring shows the city meeting its targets, avoiding any presumption trigger.

In absence of an adopted update, Portsmouth’s development control relies on the NPPF and saved policies. The council has struggled to demonstrate a five-year supply under modern requirements, leading to some appeal losses where the tilted balance was applied. Notably, proposals for high-density schemes have sometimes succeeded due to the urgent housing shortfall. The new plan’s adoption (expected in 2025) is critical for Portsmouth to regain a plan-led approach – it will set clearer parameters for height, infrastructure (such as improving transport to handle growth on Portsea Island), and contributions to meet unmet need elsewhere.

The borough has seen transformative economic developments with the Teesworks freeport and green energy projects, which may outpace the plan’s original scope. The Council has not yet launched a formal plan review, partly awaiting the outcome of the new Tees Valley mayoral Spatial Framework proposals and the trajectory of housing need (which in this area is relatively stable or declining). In practice, Redcar & Cleveland has managed to maintain land supply by reallocating brownfield sites and has not faced a flood of speculative housing in inappropriate locations – demand is modest. However, as more Teesworks jobs materialize, pressure for new housing could increase. Without an updated plan, the tilted balance could be engaged if housing delivery falls behind. A plan review in the next year or two is likely to ensure alignment with the changing economic landscape and to extend the plan period.

The housing requirement will likely be revised upward in a new plan, and Redditch has very limited land within its boundaries (being tightly encircled by Green Belt), meaning future growth may again rely on Bromsgrove accommodating development on Redditch’s edge. Until a new plan is in place (probably not before 2025), Redditch risks the tilted balance if it cannot show sufficient housing land. So far, the existing strategic sites have sustained supply, but the buffer is thinning. The Council’s strategy is to continue joint planning with Bromsgrove – a Preferred Options paper for a joint plan is anticipated in 2024. In the meantime, the 2017 Local Plan and the NPPF guide decisions. No notable speculative incursions have succeeded yet (owing to Green Belt protection around Redditch), but updating the plan is becoming urgent to avoid any pressures for unplanned Green Belt release under appeal.",

However, the overarching housing requirement stems from the 2014 strategy, which is now beyond the 5-year threshold. The borough has been meeting its targets so far, but housing pressure in Surrey remains high and a new plan will need to extend the horizon beyond 2027. As of 2025, Reigate & Banstead has not formally commenced a Core Strategy review, possibly waiting on outcomes from Surrey’s 2050 Place Ambition work and changes in national policy on Green Belt. In practice, because a substantial part of the borough is Green Belt/AONB, the tilted balance has not led to many approvals of unwanted sites – the council can still refuse speculative proposals in protected areas. That said, a few appeals have tested whether the older Core Strategy should carry full weight. The council acknowledges that a review by 2025 is necessary to avoid policy slippage. For now, the 2014/2019 plan is holding, supported by a healthy housing land supply (including ongoing developments in Horley and at Preston regeneration area). A new plan process is expected to kick off soon to plan for post-2027 growth, ensuring continued compliance and guarding against any future shortfall that developers could exploit.",

The emerging plan will likely uplift the housing requirement (Ribble Valley has seen rising demand as a commuter and retirement area) and adjust settlement boundaries accordingly, while also strengthening policies on design and climate change. Currently, with the 2014 strategy over 5 years old, Ribble Valley has faced developers pushing the tilted balance argument. The council has managed to fend off some speculative proposals by demonstrating a five-year supply, but it has had to rely on the buffer provided by the 2019 allocations. As those get built out, pressure will mount without a new plan. The risk of planning by appeal is moderate here: the borough is largely rural but doesn’t have extensive Green Belt, so some villages have been targeted for large housing schemes beyond plan limits. Adoption of the new Local Plan (expected by 2024/25) will reset the housing supply and policy framework, giving Ribble Valley renewed control over development distribution through to 2038.",

Work began on a Local Plan Review (2018–2035), including consultations up to a Preferred Option in 2021. However, the District Council was abolished in April 2023 with the formation of North Yorkshire Council. The new unitary has paused individual district plan efforts in favor of creating a unified North Yorkshire Local Plan by 2028. As a result, Richmondshire’s area continues to be governed by the 2014 strategy (and some saved older policies) for the interim. This plan is outdated; key issues like the expansion of Catterick Garrison (linked to Army restructuring) and new housing needs are not fully addressed. The housing requirement in the old plan was low and mostly met, so the council had started to allocate additional sites (e.g. in Colburn) in the review. Without that new plan, there is a policy gap. Thus far, extensive speculative development has been limited – partly because the Ministry of Defence drives much of the demand at Catterick and coordinates with the council. But as the plan remains out-of-date, any substantial private development proposals might cite the tilted balance (especially if North Yorkshire Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply for this sub-area). North Yorkshire Council will need to manage applications using the NPPF and remaining policies until the countywide plan is in place. The risk is mitigated somewhat by low market pressure in this rural area, but the uncertainty will persist until the new comprehensive plan provides up-to-date allocations and policies post-2028.",

For Rochdale, PfE allocates significant development, notably a large new mixed-use site at Heywood/Pilsworth (spanning Rochdale and Bury) to deliver housing and employment on former Green Belt, as well as smaller Green Belt releases at Smithy Bridge (Littleborough) and around Rochdale’s southern fringes. With PfE in place, Rochdale now has an up-to-date strategic plan that addresses its contributions to Greater Manchester housing and job needs up to 2037. This means that earlier uncertainty – after the 2016 Core Strategy became five years old – has been resolved: the PfE provides new targets and land supply, so Rochdale can comfortably show a five-year supply and a fifteen-year pipeline. The tilted balance is therefore not applicable; any proposals must conform to PfE and Rochdale’s remaining local policies. The council will continue to use its 2016 Development Management policies and Allocations (from the Unitary Development Plan 2006 for smaller sites) until it possibly produces a local allocations DPD to supplement PfE. In summary, with PfE, Rochdale’s plan-led system is secure, major growth is directed (especially via the PfE allocation of 1,700 homes at Heywood/Pilsworth), and the borough can resist unplanned development, focusing instead on delivering the strategic sites identified.",

    "notes": "Rochford’s existing development plan consists of its Core Strategy 2011 and older saved policies, all of which are obsolete by NPPF standards. The district attempted to develop a new Local Plan in the late 2010s; however, a draft plan faced challenges (notably over Green Belt release and unmet Southend overspill) and was never submitted. The process was effectively reset, and now Rochford, along with other South Essex authorities, is pursuing a joint approach (the South Essex Plan) in parallel to preparing its own local plan. As of 2025, no new plan is close to adoption. This absence has left Rochford vulnerable: the council lacks a five-year housing land supply and has lost appeals (e.g. large housing schemes on Green Belt edges around Rayleigh) because the tilted balance applies. The government has even intervened in some cases to ensure housing comes forward given the plan vacuum. Rochford’s situation is among the more acute in the region – almost all its land is Green Belt, so any required housing growth necessitates politically difficult Green Belt release, which the old plan avoided. With no updated plan, decisions are largely made via the NPPF’s presumption, weighing local harm vs. benefit case-by-case. The council is expediting a new Local Plan (targeting submission by 2024/25) that will likely identify specific Green Belt sites to meet its sizable housing shortfall and align with Southend’s unmet need. Until then, Rochford remains in a de facto policy vacuum, and developers are aggressively pushing proposals on what would traditionally have been safeguarded land.",

Being just a few years old, the plan is up-to-date, and Rossendale Borough can demonstrate a five-year housing supply aligned with its new allocations (although delivery on the large Edenfield site has been slower due to local opposition, it is now moving forward following adoption). With this current plan, Rossendale’s development management decisions are firmly plan-led. The council has successfully defended against appeals on unallocated sites because it can point to the fresh strategy and allocated alternatives. The tilted balance is not engaged. Moving forward, Rossendale will monitor its plan but likely won’t need a review until closer to 2026, unless housing delivery significantly deviates from projections. The 2021 plan has thus greatly reduced speculative development risk, providing certainty for both developers and communities in this East Lancashire authority.",

The Council is progressing a new Local Plan covering 2020–2040, which will likely allocate additional sites around Bexhill and perhaps modest growth in rural service centres to meet higher targets and factor in unmet Hastings needs. This new plan has been through consultation but not yet submitted. In the interim, Rother has struggled with five-year supply calculations and in late 2021 conceded it fell short, forcing it to grant some contentious applications (e.g., extra greenfield units on the edges of villages under the tilted balance). Since then, the council has tried to manage supply by approving sustainable reserve sites from the 2019 allocations to fend off less suitable proposals. The adoption of the updated plan (expected 2024) should rectify this by boosting land supply and extending the policy framework to 2040. Until then, the district remains somewhat vulnerable: with much of Rother designated High Weald AONB, truly speculative large schemes are limited, but non-AONB areas (like around Bexhill and Battle) have seen developer interest. Getting the new plan in place will secure Rother’s ability to plan-led meet development needs while protecting its sensitive landscapes from ad hoc development.",

As of 2025, Rotherham has been delivering well on this plan – major developments like Waverley new community and town centre housing on brownfield are progressing. The plan is effectively current because the detailed allocations are recent, and the Council can demonstrate a healthy five-year supply (Rotherham’s latest monitoring indicates over 7 years supply, aided by the strategic sites coming forward). Therefore, even though the Core Strategy is 11 years old, its policies haven’t been deemed out-of-date due to the successful implementation via the 2018 document.

That plan facilitated large-scale redevelopment in Greenwich Peninsula, Woolwich, and Charlton.

Greenwich is in the process of preparing a **new Local Plan (Greenwich Plan 2021-2036)**; a Regulation 18 draft was consulted on in 2023. The new plan will refine where additional housing can go – likely with further intensification in town centres, estates renewal, Charlton riverside development, and the continuing build-out of Thamesmead (coordinated with Peabody and cross-river transport improvements). In the interim, Greenwich relies heavily on the London Plan (2021) to make development decisions. The borough has generally been meeting housing delivery (thanks to thousands of units on the Peninsula and in Woolwich), but some unallocated sites have come forward to help hit annual targets, raising issues when the council tries to refuse them on outdated policy grounds. The tilted balance could be argued if Greenwich faltered on supply, but so far it has maintained enough pipeline. Nonetheless, without an updated local plan, the borough’s ability to shape certain outcomes (e.g., securing maximum affordable housing or timely infrastructure for new growth areas) is somewhat constrained by the need to defer to strategic London Plan policies. Prompt progression of the Greenwich Plan will restore a locally-specific, up-to-date policy framework attuned to the borough’s needs while complementing the London Plan objectives.",

With this adoption, Kensington & Chelsea’s planning framework is current and aligned with the latest London Plan. The borough is uniquely constrained (very little undeveloped land and strict conservation controls), so the plan focuses on making the most of brownfield capacity (e.g., Kensal Canalside opportunity area is a key allocation for mixed-use development). The new plan also addresses community concerns around density and design after the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Because RBKC’s plan is now up-to-date, the NPPF presumption does not apply – not that RBKC has unmet land supply issues, given its modest housing target and the primacy of London Plan guidance. The council can robustly enforce its policies (which include some of the strictest building design and neighbourly development rules in London). In summary, RBKC faces low plan-related risk; with the 2024 plan it retains strong local control and can resist any proposals that don’t accord with its finely tuned local policies, without vulnerability to appeals on grounds of an out-of-date plan.",

The borough worked on a new Local Plan (calling it the “Kingston Local Plan”) and consulted on drafts in 2019 and 2020, but progress stalled, partly due to the pandemic and uncertainty over Crossrail 2 (now paused) which had underpinned some growth assumptions. As of 2025, Kingston is re-launching its Local Plan effort – a revised draft is expected to go to Regulation 19 consultation. This plan will need to identify how to accommodate much higher housing numbers, likely through tall buildings and mixed-use redevelopment in Kingston Town Centre, Norbiton (including the large Cambridge Road Estate renewal), and possibly releasing some industrial land. Until the new plan is adopted (likely 2025), Kingston makes decisions using the London Plan and any still-relevant local policies. The council has approved several high-density schemes in the town centre (e.g., around the train station) to demonstrate commitment to meeting targets, but also faced developer pressure on other sites. Without an updated plan, Kingston’s development control runs the risk of appeals where developers argue the 2012 policies carry less weight. Indeed, Kingston has struggled to maintain a five-year supply – recent monitoring showed shortfalls – invoking the tilted balance in a few cases. The new Local Plan is critical to reset the supply by allocating additional sites (Kingston likely will allow more tall residential towers and intensification of suburban areas). In the interim, the borough is somewhat vulnerable to appeals, but the strong direction of the London Plan and Mayor’s oversight on large applications have so far helped manage growth in a coordinated way.",

It also plans for some growth in Windsor and village areas while balancing extensive Green Belt and floodplain constraints. With the plan adopted relatively recently, RBWM’s policies are up-to-date. The borough can comfortably demonstrate a five-year housing supply (the Maidenhead sites are progressing through planning, and a couple have started delivery). As such, the tilted balance does not apply. The plan significantly boosts the borough’s housing trajectory (RBWM had a historic undersupply which this plan is correcting), and it also addresses infrastructure – for example, it ties housing releases to delivery of a new Maidenhead bypass link. RBWM is not currently working on a new plan since the ink is barely dry on the 2022 one; focus is on implementation. Some local controversies remain (like protecting the character of smaller settlements from infill), but the existence of the adopted plan allows the Council to defend against proposals outside the agreed strategy. Overall, RBWM’s planning risk profile is low at present – with an adopted plan in place, decisions are plan-led and speculative development that doesn’t accord with the Borough Local Plan can be refused with confidence.",

    "notes": "The Rugby Borough Local Plan 2011–2031 was adopted in June 2019. It allocated major sustainable urban extensions (notably the 6,200-home Southwest Rugby allocation) and released land at the urban edge to accommodate some of Coventry’s unmet housing need. This plan is relatively recent and in-date. Rugby has been experiencing rapid growth – housing delivery has exceeded targets thanks to sites like Houlton (the former radio station new town) – so the borough currently can demonstrate a healthy land supply. To maintain momentum and plan for the long term, Rugby has commenced a Local Plan Review for the period up to 2041. An Issues consultation took place, examining options including additional development north of Rugby town and further allocations to meet Coventry’s continued overspill beyond 2031. As of 2025, that review is in early stages, meaning the 2019 plan remains the operative policy. Because the plan is under five years old, its policies carry full weight and the tilted balance is not engaged. The council can refuse speculative proposals that don’t align with the spatial strategy (and has done so, for instance, proposals in villages beyond what the plan allows have been dismissed at appeal referencing the new plan). Nonetheless, by later in 2024 the five-year mark approaches, so completing the review by around 2026 will be important. Provided Rugby keeps its supply above requirements – which the large allocations help ensure – it should remain in a strong position. The planned South West Rugby urban extension is critical: it delivers new homes plus a link road, and Rugby’s ability to show progress there staves off arguments of land supply shortfall. Overall, Rugby’s planning framework is solid for now and the proactive review will ensure it stays ahead of any NPPF default triggers.",

    "notes": "Runnymede’s Local Plan (2015–2030) was adopted in July 2020.

Because of these allocations and a healthy pipeline (including sites under construction like Longcross and the Addlestone One redevelopment), Runnymede can demonstrate a solid housing supply through the plan period. The plan is current, with policies aligned to the 2012 NPPF (under which it was examined) and generally consistent with the 2021 NPPF as well. The Council is not yet undertaking a formal review; it committed to assess by 2025 whether one is needed (especially to extend the plan beyond 2030). In development control, Runnymede’s decisions are plan-led, and it has successfully defended refusals on non-allocated Green Belt sites since adoption, as it can point to sufficient allocated alternatives. The tilted balance does not apply given the up-to-date plan and a more than five-year supply in hand. The main focus for Runnymede is delivery – ensuring that Longcross and other major sites proceed on schedule (any significant delay might prompt pressure for additional interim sites). Provided those stay on track, Runnymede faces low risk from speculative development. When the time comes, a new plan looking to 2040 will be prepared, but until then the 2020 Local Plan offers a robust framework.",

    "notes": "Rushcliffe, a borough adjacent to Nottingham, currently relies on the **Aligned Core Strategy 2014 (joint with Nottingham and Broxtowe) and its own Local Plan Part 2 adopted in 2019. These provided for significant growth, notably the 3,000-home Fairham Pastures development (south of Nottingham) and major expansions of Bingham and East Leake. Many of those sites are now well into development, and Rushcliffe’s housing delivery has been strong. However, the strategic framework is dated, and the borough’s housing need remains high – driven by both local demand and unmet need from Nottingham City. To address this, Rushcliffe is participating in the new Greater Nottingham Strategic Plan (GNSP), with a draft published in Nov 2024. The GNSP proposes further growth for Rushcliffe to 2045, likely including new settlement options (a possible garden village near East Leake or somewhere along the A46) and Green Belt adjustments around Nottingham’s fringe. Until the GNSP is adopted (expected by 2025), Rushcliffe’s policy weight is slightly reduced due to the age of the 2014 strategy. The council has worked to maintain a five-year supply – it currently has one, thanks to the large allocations – which has helped avoid the tilted balance so far. But applications for additional sites (especially in villages not allocated) have been coming forward, arguing the need for more housing beyond the old targets. Rushcliffe has mostly resisted these, pending the new plan’s direction. The risk is moderate: if any of the big sites stall or if Nottingham’s unmet need escalates without a plan in place, speculative proposals could gain traction. The timely completion of the GNSP will be key to securing a refreshed strategy, after which Rushcliffe will proceed to align its local development plan documents. In the meantime, the borough’s substantial committed supply acts as a buffer against unplanned development.",

    "notes": "Rushmoor’s Local Plan (2014–2032) was adopted in February 2019. This plan carried forward the substantial Wellesley (Aldershot Urban Extension) project which is delivering ~3,850 homes on former military land, and it identified additional housing capacity largely through urban redevelopment in Aldershot and Farnborough town centres (and by absorbing some overspill demand from adjoining Surrey). At adoption, Rushmoor had more housing planned than required, allowing it to assist Hart District under the Housing Market Area agreement. As of 2025, implementation is on track: Wellesley continues to build out hundreds of units per year, and several town centre sites have been completed or are under construction (e.g., in Farnborough). The Local Plan is current and the Borough comfortably demonstrates a five-year supply (Rushmoor’s latest housing land supply was about 9.5 years, reflecting the strong delivery at Wellesley). Thus, all policies (including those protecting certain employment zones and environmental constraints like the Thames Basin Heaths SPA mitigation) carry full weight, and the tilted balance is not engaged. The council has not needed to commence a new plan yet; it will likely do so by 2024/25 mainly to extend the timeframe beyond 2032, but there is no immediate urgency or shortfall. In effect, Rushmoor’s 2019 plan has de-risked development – it laid out clear parameters that developers have largely followed. Barring any major unexpected surge in housing need or failure of the Wellesley project (which is unlikely given its success to date), Rushmoor faces minimal speculative development pressure. It can continue to make planning decisions with a robust adopted policy framework behind them.",

    "notes": "Tiny Rutland has endured a turbulent recent planning history. Its Core Strategy 2011 and associated documents are seriously out-of-date, yet they remain the statutory plan after a replacement effort failed. In early 2021, Rutland County Council had a new Local Plan at examination which included a large new garden community at St. George’s Barracks (a former MOD base) to meet much of its growth. However, amid local opposition and concerns over infrastructure funding (particularly the cost of a new school), the Council withdrew that draft plan in September 2021, despite the inspector’s initial indications that it could be made sound. This left Rutland without an up-to-date plan and no allocated sites beyond 2026, effectively a policy vacuum. Developers have since targeted sites around Oakham and Uppingham, leading to appeals where the tilted balance has been applied against the council. Acknowledging this untenable situation, a new Local Plan process was launched in 2022. Rutland accelerated work and re-submitted a Local Plan in February 2025 (omitting the prior garden village, and instead dispersing housing around existing towns and larger villages). During this limbo, planning decisions have heavily relied on the NPPF. The council has had to approve some unplanned housing to avoid total absence of supply (recent approvals on Oakham’s edge were granted to boost short-term numbers). The submitted 2025 plan aims to restore a plan-led approach and will, if adopted, run to 2041 with more modest strategic allocations. Until adoption (likely in 2025/26), Rutland remains highly vulnerable to speculative proposals. The new plan’s swift examination and adoption are critical to end the current reliance on antiquated 2011 policies and to give the county a sustainable development strategy that balances growth with Rutland’s unique character.",

PfE includes Salford and eight other GM authorities (excluding Stockport) and sets out strategic growth to 2037. For Salford, PfE confirms major projects: the expansion of Port Salford (with multimodal freight infrastructure and new employment land) and a large housing allocation on Chat Moss (the “GM Allocation 32 – East of Irlam”) to deliver around 800 homes with accompanying peatland mitigation. It also works alongside Salford’s ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas like Ordsall and Salford Quays, which are mostly covered by the city’s own development management plan (Salford has a separate Local Plan: Development Management adopted in 2022). With PfE, Salford now has an up-to-date strategic plan, meaning no gap in its development plan coverage remains. The city can comfortably demonstrate a five-year supply given the enormous pipeline of apartment schemes in Salford Central and MediaCity and now the addition of PfE greenfield allocations for later in the plan period. The tilted balance is not applicable – Salford can enforce its plan-led vision. The council will shortly incorporate PfE allocations into its local planning decisions and may prepare area-specific guidance for the new allocations. Having this adopted plan greatly reduces planning risk: prior to PfE, Salford had occasionally faced challenges on Green Belt release at appeal, but now any release is happening through the plan (as at Irlam). Salford’s focus can shift to delivery and fine-tuning local policies, with plan-making largely resolved for the next decade.",

    "notes": "Sandwell, as part of the Black Country, has been operating under the Black Country Core Strategy 2011–2026, adopted in 2011. A planned Black Country Plan review (covering Sandwell, Dudley, Walsall, Wolverhampton) reached an advanced draft in 2022, but was abandoned when Dudley MBC withdrew over Green Belt release concerns. This left Sandwell without an updated joint plan. In response, Sandwell quickly moved to prepare its own Sandwell Local Plan, which it submitted for examination in Dec 2024. The emerging plan seeks to meet Sandwell’s growth needs to 2041 within its urban area to the extent possible (by regenerating brownfield and increasing densities in centres like West Bromwich), but acknowledges a significant shortfall of housing land due to lack of developable sites – Sandwell is built-up and has tight boundaries. That shortfall will rely on agreements with neighboring areas (notably South Staffordshire, though progress on that is uncertain). In the interim, Sandwell’s policies are out-of-date and it cannot demonstrate a five-year housing supply, having one of the lowest delivery rates relative to target in the country. This has started to engage the tilted balance, though opportunities for speculative greenfield development are limited (Sandwell has very little Green Belt or fringe land – most unmet need would have to be accommodated outside the borough). Instead, the main risk is that without an adopted plan, it’s harder for Sandwell to compel redevelopment of difficult brownfield sites or resist non-residential uses taking potential housing land. The timely adoption of the new plan (expected in 2025) will solidify allocations (including several sites currently in employment use that are proposed to switch to housing) and strengthen policy for securing contributions from any overspill sites outside Sandwell. Until then, Sandwell remains in a precarious position planning-wise, relying on the NPPF and goodwill of neighbors.",

    "notes": "Scarborough’s 2011-2032 Local Plan was adopted in 2017 and provided a development framework for the coastal borough (including Scarborough town, Whitby, and Filey). By 2023, the Borough Council was abolished, becoming part of North Yorkshire Council. The 2017 plan is thus out-of-date on the five-year criterion and will not be reviewed separately. Instead, the new North Yorkshire Council will incorporate Scarborough’s future needs in its countywide Local Plan. Until that is in place (targeted for 2027), the 2017 Scarborough Local Plan remains the operative plan for the area. This plan had allocated a range of housing sites around Scarborough and Whitby, some of which have progressed, though others (particularly in Whitby) have lagged due to market factors and infrastructure. Currently, North Yorkshire Council can still cite the 2017 plan policies to guide decisions – many remain relevant (e.g., tourism development controls, conserving the National Park fringe). However, if significant new housing proposals come that exceed the 2017 plan’s allocations, the council may have limited grounds to refuse purely on policy since the plan is aging and the housing requirement evidence is superseded. The tilted balance could be argued by developers if a shortfall in land supply is demonstrated (which is possible if some allocated sites do not deliver as expected). In practice, Scarborough’s housing market is modest and environmental constraints (Moors, coastal erosion, etc.) limit large speculative schemes, so major conflicts have been few. Nonetheless, the longer the gap before a new plan, the greater the risk that piecemeal developments could come forward not fully aligned with a strategic vision. North Yorkshire Council will likely lean on the NPPF and the 2017 plan where possible to manage development until the comprehensive new Local Plan provides an updated framework.",

    "notes": "The former Sedgemoor District (around Bridgwater and Burnham-on-Sea) adopted its Local Plan 2011-2032 in February 2019.

When Somerset became a unitary in April 2023, Sedgemoor’s plan became part of the patchwork of inherited plans for the new Somerset Council. Among those, Sedgemoor’s is the most recent and up-to-date. The policies and allocations in Sedgemoor’s 2019 plan continue to be implemented – for example, Bridgwater’s housing sites are progressing well and employment land take-up near Junction 23 (M5) is strong. Somerset Council will replace this with a new county-wide Local Plan by ~2028, but until then, the Sedgemoor section of Somerset has a current plan and does not face the same degree of vulnerability as other parts of the county that had older plans (e.g., Mendip or West Somerset). Sedgemoor can demonstrate a five-year housing supply (it had a surplus upon the last assessment), so the tilted balance is not an issue in this patch. Any development proposals in the Sedgemoor area are being assessed against the relatively recent 2019 policies, which carry full weight – Somerset Council has even used them as a model when handling applications elsewhere in the county for consistency. In summary, the Sedgemoor area’s planning is on a solid footing through the transition to the unitary, and it will smoothly roll into the new Somerset-wide plan when that is prepared, without a high risk of unplanned development in the interim.",

    "notes": "Sefton’s Local Plan (2030 horizon) was adopted in 2017 after identifying extensive development land via Green Belt release around Formby, Crosby, Maghull (including a new Maghull garden settlement of 1,600 homes), and Southport. The plan significantly boosted Sefton’s housing supply. As of 2025, those allocations are in various stages: some have progressed (the Maghull East site is under construction), others have faced delays due to land ownership or infrastructure. The plan is now just over 8 years from adoption, so technically out-of-date by NPPF definitions. However, Sefton has generally managed to maintain a five-year housing supply thanks to the allocated sites – the latest report showed around 5.6 years – and housing delivery is roughly on target overall. The Council has not yet launched a Local Plan review, likely due to uncertainty around wider sub-regional needs (Sefton is part of the Liverpool City Region) and waiting to see the completion of current allocations. If some allocated sites (e.g., some in Formby facing constraints) do not deliver, Sefton might slip under a five-year supply, triggering the tilted balance. There have been a few appeals on unallocated sites recently where developers argued the plan is aging; so far the council has successfully defended using its supply calculations. Nonetheless, to avoid future risk, a plan review by 2025/26 may be prudent – potentially to extend the plan to 2040 and adjust for any shortfalls or new economic opportunities (like the Freeport at the Port of Liverpool expansion affecting Sefton’s employment land). Until then, Sefton relies on its 2017 plan which, while aging, is still fundamentally aligned with Merseyside’s growth pattern and thus remains a relatively sound basis for decisions. The planning risk is moderate: manageable now, but could increase if any major site fails to materialize or if unmet needs from neighbors (e.g., Liverpool’s shortfall) put pressure on Sefton without an updated plan.",

However, the district was abolished in April 2023 into North Yorkshire, and the new unitary has paused separate adoption to integrate this work into the North Yorkshire Local Plan. As such, Selby area’s 2013 strategy remains the official plan, and many of its housing allocations are either built or in advanced stages (Selby had high housing delivery, often exceeding targets). Nonetheless, the plan is out-of-date and didn’t anticipate the full scale of current demand – Selby’s location near Leeds/York makes it a hotspot for commuters, and recent years saw numerous speculative proposals. Selby District Council had managed to maintain a five-year supply by quickly approving sustainable urban extensions around Selby and Sherburn; however, with the old plan’s horizon nearing and some villages lacking up-to-date boundaries, developers have pushed at the edges. The tilted balance had started to become a factor in decisions for out-of-plan sites, which is one reason the new plan was being expedited. Now, North Yorkshire Council must bridge this gap. It will likely use the nearly-ready Selby plan content when forming the county plan, but that delay means a few more years where Selby area decisions rely on aged policies plus the NPPF. Fortunately, many needed sites already have permission (Selby’s housing requirement is essentially met up to 2027), so the risk of large unplanned approvals may be moderate. Still, smaller speculative applications in villages might succeed if the council cannot cite an up-to-date local policy. Overall, the situation underscores the importance of completing the North Yorkshire plan to cover areas like Selby that are coasting on an aging strategy amid dynamic growth pressures.",

    "notes": "Sevenoaks District has been without an up-to-date plan for years. Its *Core Strategy 2011 and saved local plan policies from 2000 are in force but far from compliant with current needs. Sevenoaks attempted to adopt a new Local Plan in 2019, but that plan was found unsound in March 2020 due to a failure of the Duty to Cooperate (it didn’t adequately secure neighboring help to meet Sevenoaks’ substantial unmet housing need in full). Consequently, the council withdrew that plan after legal challenges failed. As of 2025, Sevenoaks is working on a fresh *Local Plan 2040, having done Issues & Options consultations. However, adoption is at least a year or two away. In this vacuum, Sevenoaks has had to evaluate applications primarily on NPPF grounds. The district is 93% Green Belt, so its 2011 plan deliberately underprovided housing – which means Sevenoaks has not been able to demonstrate a five-year supply for years. The tilted balance is therefore engaged by default. This led to multiple appeals and approvals on Green Belt sites contrary to local preferences. The council has been resisting major incursions, but pressure is high: in 2022 a developer even submitted a proposal to the Planning Inspectorate directly (via a s.62A route) for a large Green Belt housing scheme, citing the council’s lack of plan (though that was refused, it exemplifies the desperation). Sevenoaks is, in effect, operating in a development management by appeal scenario, where only National policy and the Green Belt’s absolute protection in NPPF (except in Very Special Circumstances) provide boundaries. This is the most extreme example of plan risk – until Sevenoaks gets a new plan in place (which will inevitably involve some Green Belt release agreed through plan-making, plus reliance on neighbors like Tunbridge Wells or Bromley to take overflow), the district remains highly exposed. Each application is a battle of weighing unmet needs versus Green Belt harm. The forthcoming plan will aim to allocate certain Green Belt sites in a controlled way to meet part of the need, thus restoring some plan-led order. But until adoption, Sevenoaks faces a planning policy vacuum of the highest order.",

A new ‘Sheffield Plan’ covering 2022–2039 was finally submitted in Oct 2023 and is in examination. In the interim, Sheffield’s housing shortfall and aging policies have meant reliance on the NPPF’s presumption, though a brownfield-first approach has mitigated Green Belt loss pending the new plan.",
    "notes": "Sheffield has had an elongated plan hiatus. Its *Core Strategy 2009 (to 2026) is very out-of-date, and a subsequent City Policies and Sites plan was never adopted. As a result, development decisions have leaned on that old Core Strategy (which emphasized brownfield regeneration and set modest housing targets) plus the 2019 South Yorkshire Spatial Framework (non-statutory) and the NPPF. The city’s housing delivery fell behind modern requirements, with supply constrained by a longstanding political commitment to minimal Green Belt release. This led to a significant shortfall – by 2020 Sheffield consistently fell below a five-year supply, engaging the tilted balance for many proposals. However, because the city had ample brownfield opportunities, many developers focused on central sites anyway (leading to a boom in city centre apartments). The critical pressure point became the lack of allocated sites for family housing – evidenced by rising unmet need and appeals on the urban fringe. Recognizing this, Sheffield City Council finally produced a new Sheffield Local Plan 2022-2039, which it **submitted in October 2023. This plan proposes allocating around 20,000 homes, including selective Green Belt releases (a major shift for Sheffield) especially in the southeast of the city, to ensure a deliverable pipeline. Until this plan is adopted (likely 2024/25), Sheffield remains vulnerable: the council has already lost or had to concede appeals for lack of five-year supply (notably around Owlthorpe and Deepcar). The new plan’s examination will determine if the chosen Green Belt sites are sufficient or need expanding. For now, Sheffield continues assessing proposals case-by-case – favoring brownfield but increasingly acknowledging that some edge expansions may be necessary even ahead of plan adoption to avoid worse speculative outcomes. The risk level is high but on the cusp of resolution; an adopted Sheffield Plan will substantially lower it by establishing a clear development framework and restoring plan-led control after years of planning by default.",

    "notes": "Shropshire’s current plan comprises a 2011 Core Strategy and a 2015 Site Allocations & Management of Development (SAMDev) Plan. These documents are out-of-date – they planned growth only to 2026. The Council prepared a new Local Plan (2016–2038) and submitted it in September 2021. However, the examination has faced delays, primarily over the need to ensure no harm to protected river habitats (the River Clun SAC) from development phosphorus runoff. Hearings concluded in 2022, and Shropshire is working on Main Modifications (including stronger environmental mitigation and perhaps slightly reduced site capacities) to satisfy the Inspector. In the interim, many of Shropshire’s allocated sites from 2015 are built or underway, and the county has a sizable housing land supply pipeline (especially around Shrewsbury and the growth corridors). This has somewhat buffered the absence of an up-to-date plan: the Council has managed to maintain around a five-year supply, and major speculative proposals have been limited. That said, without an adopted new plan, certain policies (like updated employment land strategies or rural housing flexibility) are in limbo, and any slippage in supply could quickly engage the tilted balance (which the Council is keen to avoid). Assuming the new Local Plan is adopted in 2024, Shropshire will have an up-to-date strategy providing for housing and employment to 2038 (including new strategic settlements east of Shrewsbury and near Junction 3 of the M54). This will solidify the policy position. Until then, Shropshire is operating with caution – approving needed developments where appropriate to shore up supply and relying on national policy to fill gaps – and looking forward to finally replacing its aging plan to remove any lingering uncertainty for investors and communities.",

Housing delivery relies on high-density brownfield redevelopment, but Slough continues to have a large unmet need which adjacent areas have resisted taking – leaving a persistent policy gap and reliance on the NPPF.",
    "notes": "Slough’s planning framework is outdated. Its Core Strategy was adopted in 2008 (to 2026) and a Site Allocations plan in 2010. The Council’s attempt to prepare a new Local Plan has been slow; a draft Preferred Options was consulted in 2020, but as of 2025 it has not been submitted. Slough’s dilemma is that it is a small, urban borough essentially at capacity – nearly all available land is developed or Green Belt (Colnbrook area) or needed for employment (due to proximity to Heathrow). The 2020 draft Local Plan frankly acknowledged that Slough cannot meet its government-calculated housing need within its boundaries and asked neighbors (South Bucks in particular) to help. That request has so far not been agreed (South Bucks’ own plan was withdrawn in 2020). Consequently, Slough has been approving virtually all feasible housing redevelopment within the town (e.g. office-to-residential conversions, estate renewals at higher densities). This has kept housing delivery numbers somewhat up, but still far below the required level. The tilted balance is effectively in play – any proposal that can deliver housing is hard for the Council to refuse unless it causes clear harm, because its lack of five-year supply and up-to-date plan makes appeals likely to succeed. However, opportunities for “speculative” development are few given Slough’s geography; most new housing will come from council-led or partnership schemes to build upwards, such as the “Slough Urban Renewal” projects. The plan vacuum primarily impacts strategic decisions – for example, a potential large expansion into Green Belt (if ever considered) would have to come via a local plan, which is stalled. The Council is now under pressure (and possible government intervention threats) to get a new Local Plan in place by 2025. Until then, Slough’s planning decisions rely on the NPPF presumption and whatever relevant saved policies remain (mostly for design and environmental health). The risk and reality is that Slough’s development is being driven by short-term opportunities rather than a long-term spatial strategy, pending the overdue new Local Plan.",

A Draft Submission Plan (including significant Green Belt releases and the UK Central HS2 interchange site) was well advanced and under examination, but the Council withdrew it in Oct 2024 due to uncertainties and likely soundness issues. This leaves Solihull without an updated plan at a time of major growth pressure, increasing reliance on the NPPF and ad hoc decisions until a new plan is prepared.",
    "notes": "Solihull’s last local plan was adopted in December 2013. Recognizing it needed to plan for HS2’s arrival and a higher housing target (including some of Birmingham’s unmet need), Solihull developed a comprehensive Draft Submission Plan and submitted it in 2021. That plan proposed large Green Belt releases (notably for a new garden village at The Triangle and major expansion near Shirley) and a vision for the UK Central Hub around the new HS2 Interchange. Examination proved challenging: there were doubts about deliverability and duty-to-cooperate (especially with neighboring Black Country authorities). In October 2024, Solihull formally withdrew the draft plan from examination, citing the evolving national policy landscape and a need to reconsider spatial options. As a result, Solihull is effectively back to using its 2013 plan for decisions. Many of its strategic aims (like focusing growth in north Solihull regeneration areas and allowing limited village development) have largely been met, and housing sites identified there are built out. Meanwhile, the borough faces intense development pressure: the HS2 node is underway and expected to drive demand for commercial and residential development. Without an updated plan, Solihull must determine applications case-by-case. Some sites that were earmarked in the withdrawn plan (e.g. land near Balsall Common) are coming forward anyway via planning applications, and the council will have to judge them on current NPPF merits – essentially meaning the tilted balance if housing land supply is deemed insufficient. The risk is moderate to high: Solihull still has significant Green Belt which provides a defense, but its housing shortfall (especially for affordable and family homes) is growing. The council intends to reset the plan process, perhaps collaborating more with neighbors or scaling back certain allocations, but a new plan is likely 2-3 years away. In the interim, Solihull’s planning decisions will rely on 2013 policies (many of which are outdated) and national guidance, trying to avoid piecemeal erosion of Green Belt before a new comprehensive strategy can be agreed.",

A new single Somerset Local Plan is being prepared (Call for Sites in 2024) to unify the strategy by around 2028. Until then, plan coverage is uneven: some areas have up-to-date policies, others face policy gaps and tilted balance situations.",
    "notes": "When Somerset became a unitary authority in April 2023, it inherited the local plans of Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset, and Somerset West & Taunton. These are of varying ages and quality. Sedgemoor’s 2019 Plan is up-to-date and delivering well, while Mendip’s 2014 Plan is out-of-date, with Mendip having failed to adopt a replacement (a 2022 consultation plan was not finished). South Somerset’s 2015 Plan is also outdated, and Somerset West & Taunton’s 2020 Plan (covering Taunton area) was fairly recent but that district ceased to exist after just a few years. Somerset Council is now working on a new county-wide Local Plan, with initial scoping and a Call for Sites launched in early 2024. The goal is to have an adopted plan by 2027/28, setting consistent growth targets and policies across the county. In the meantime, the planning regime is patchy: in Sedgemoor (Bridgwater area) and Taunton, the existing plans still carry weight and those areas can manage development with minimal issue. Conversely, in former Mendip (Frome, Glastonbury, etc.), the absence of an up-to-date plan has led to speculative applications, and the tilted balance has been invoked (some large greenfield housing schemes near Frome have come forward against the old plan’s intentions due to housing shortfall). Somerset Council has been handling these by pragmatically using whatever saved policies exist and the NPPF to negotiate the best outcomes until new allocations can be made. The risk of unplanned development is therefore higher in the parts of Somerset covered by older plans, whereas areas with newer plans have more protection. The new Somerset Local Plan will resolve this by creating a single, coherent approach – likely redistributing some growth (for example, focusing more on Taunton and less on smaller towns that struggled with infrastructure). Until its adoption, the council must apply a hybrid of its predecessors’ policies, which is not ideal but is being managed through careful development management and interim supplementary guidance (e.g., a countywide design guide).",

In the interim, Southampton leans on the 2015 policies and the NPPF – it is meeting housing delivery via high-density schemes, but an updated plan is needed to provide a longer-term strategy and account for modern needs.",
    "notes": "Southampton last updated its plan with the City Centre Action Plan (2015) and a partial Core Strategy review in 2015, which itself tweaked the 2010 Core Strategy. These documents guided substantial redevelopment in the city center and along the waterfront. A significant amount of housing has been delivered through conversions and mid-rise apartment blocks in the city, keeping Southampton’s housing numbers on track in recent years. However, the plan’s evidence base and policies on newer issues (e.g., zero-carbon building, newer transport schemes like the Green City initiative) are out-of-date. The City Council embarked on preparing a new Southampton City Vision Local Plan (to 2040), and held a major Regulation 18 consultation in late 2022. Key challenges include addressing how to accommodate more family housing (the city is tightly bounded with little undeveloped land), potentially partnering with neighboring Eastleigh or Test Valley to take some unmet need, and tackling traffic congestion and air quality in the dense urban area. Until this new plan is adopted (likely by 2025/26), Southampton’s 2015-era policies remain the basis for decisions. The city has generally been able to demonstrate a five-year supply with its pipeline of brownfield sites, so it hasn’t faced many appeals on housing supply grounds (the tilted balance has not been widely triggered). The bigger risk is qualitative: without an updated plan, the council has limited ability to enforce newer priorities (for example, it’s relying on national standards for energy efficiency rather than local plan requirements that it might want to impose). Recent large proposals (e.g., redevelopment of the former daily Echo building site for high-rise flats) have been approved under existing policy but would ideally be guided by a fresh masterplan approach in the new plan. Overall, while the lack of an updated plan hasn’t caused a housing land supply crisis in Southampton, it does leave a strategic vacuum for the medium-term development of the city. The forthcoming City Vision plan will fill that, ensuring growth (including possible urban extensions on the city fringe if needed) is properly planned alongside infrastructure – something that is difficult under the piecemeal current framework.",

South Cambridgeshire has seen rapid housing delivery under this plan, and many strategic sites are well underway or complete. Because the plan is reasonably recent, its policies are up-to-date, and the two councils can demonstrate a healthy combined five-year supply (over 6.1 years as per the latest annual monitor). Work is ongoing on the next Greater Cambridge Local Plan 2041, which has gone through Issues & Options and will allocate additional land largely focused on sustainable locations (with an emphasis on sites near new railway stations and possibly further expansion at Cambourne or a new village along the A428). That plan has faced some delay due to water supply constraints (the chalk aquifer serving the area is limited), but innovative solutions (like a proposed water reservoir in Fenland) are being factored in. Adoption of the new plan is expected around 2025. In the interim, the 2018 plan continues to function effectively: the tilted balance is not engaged because housing delivery and supply have exceeded targets (indeed, the area often runs into the opposite problem of managing very high growth). The main risk in not having an updated plan yet is manageable – if certain new strategic infrastructure (like East West Rail or Cambridge metro) materializes, the current plan may not reflect opportunities around those, but that is a matter of optimizing growth rather than risking unplanned sprawl. All in all, South Cambridgeshire’s planning is on solid footing with an active, modern plan and a clearly defined path to the next one, keeping plan-led development firmly in control.",

This plan has successfully guided substantial development, especially on the edge of Derby City (South Derbyshire contributes several large housing sites to meet the wider Derby HMA need) and in/around Swadlincote. The district has met its targets so far, with a five-year supply reported. However, with the plan’s end date of 2028 approaching and the housing demand in the Derby area remaining high, the council commenced a partial review of the Local Plan Part 1 in 2023. The review (Reg 18) is considering options up to 2041, including potentially a new settlement (there was speculation of a “Drakelow Garden Village” in the previous regional plan context) and further expansion of existing settlements. As of 2025, that review is underway but not yet at submission. The adopted 2016/17 plan is technically out-of-date on the NPPF’s 5-year rule, but because the council proactively confirmed via a 2021 review that policies remained effective and it has an ongoing update process, inspectors have generally allowed continued use of the existing policies. The risk of speculative development has been moderate: developers have brought a few proposals on unallocated sites arguing the plan is aging, but South Derbyshire’s ability to show a surplus of housing land (partly due to oversupply around Derby and the Drakelow power station redevelopment coming forward) has helped fend off the tilted balance in decisions. Nonetheless, further delay in adopting the new plan could increase risk, as more time passes since 2016. With the major allotments from the current plan largely committed, the council does need the new plan to identify the next phase of growth locations (and to handle issues like updated flood risk mapping and infrastructure for the growing commuter settlements). Overall, while not in crisis, South Derbyshire is keen to get its revised plan in place by around 2025 to ensure continuity of a plan-led approach and to avoid any vacuum as the 2016/17 plan ages beyond its effective lifespan.",

This plan is current and sets a strategy of conserving the landscape and cultural heritage of the South Downs while allowing only small-scale development to meet local needs (approximately 250 homes per year across the whole park). It also contains bespoke dark night skies policies and controls on visitor-related development. Being relatively new, the plan’s policies are fully in line with the NPPF and the Park’s statutory purposes, and the Authority is rigorously applying them – for example, refusing major developments that do not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. The housing delivered under this plan is on track via allocated brownfield sites in places like Petworth and small infill in villages. Because the National Park’s duty is conservation, lack of housing supply does not trigger the tilted balance in the usual way (footnote 7 of NPPF excludes protected areas from the presumption). Therefore, plan risk is inherently low. SDNPA will eventually consider a review (possibly around 2025-2027) mainly to extend the plan beyond 2033 and incorporate updated climate change mitigation targets. For now, the 2019 plan provides a robust framework – it is one of the more recently adopted in the region – and the National Park is largely insulated from speculative development pressure by virtue of national policy protection. In summary, the South Downs Local Plan is up-to-date and effective, and the National Park Authority is firmly in control of planning decisions through its policies, with no significant vulnerabilities to unplanned development.",

    "notes": "Southend-on-Sea (now a city) has not had a new Local Plan in the era of the NPPF. Its Core Strategy 2007 (to 2021) is extremely out-of-date, and though some Development Management DPDs were adopted in 2015, the strategic framework for growth is lacking. Southend’s challenge is acute: it is densely built, with its few remaining open areas either Green Belt or environmentally sensitive Thames Estuary habitats. The 2007 plan anticipated modest growth (housing target ~2,000 for 2001-2021), far below current needs (which are around 1,200 homes per year under the standard method). Southend has been preparing a new Local Plan since 2019; Issues & Options were consulted, identifying potential intensified development in the central area and perhaps some Green Belt release at Shoeburyness. However, as of 2025, a draft plan is not yet submitted. This leaves Southend in a de facto continuous presumption-in-favor scenario. The council has tried to accommodate demand by approving very high-density flatted schemes especially in Southend town centre and along the seafront (for example, several tower block proposals have been permitted in recent years). These have boosted housing numbers but also raised concerns about infrastructure capacity and changing townscape character absent a holistic plan. Despite these efforts, Southend still cannot demonstrate a five-year supply or meet its Housing Delivery Test, so the tilted balance applies by default. The risk is that without a plan, development may not be optimally distributed – e.g., there’s pressure on green wedges like Belfairs, and without a plan the council struggles to defend them if proposals come forward. The new Local Plan (when eventually adopted) will likely call for intense urban renewal and negotiation with neighbors (like Basildon or Rochford) to take overflow. Until then, Southend’s planning is essentially reactive: any sustainable site that can deliver housing is looked on favorably to avoid appeals, and the city must manage the consequences (parking, services) as best as it can. The situation underscores an urgent need for the new plan to bring clarity and reduce the current reliance on the NPPF’s default provisions.",

The current plan’s major sites (e.g., new neighbourhoods at Cribbs/Patchway) are largely committed, but an updated plan is needed to identify further housing capacity and address modern challenges like Buckover Garden Village (now canceled).",
    "notes": "South Gloucestershire’s existing plan was adopted in two parts: a Core Strategy in 2013 and a Policies, Sites & Places Plan in 2014. These allocated significant development, including major urban extensions north of Bristol (such as at Cribbs Causeway/Patchway and East of Harry Stoke) which are now well underway, and a now-shelved proposal for Buckover Garden Village (omitted after the West of England Joint Spatial Plan failed in 2019). With the abolition of the JSP, South Glos has reoriented to a local plan approach. It has produced a draft New Local Plan 2025-2041 (Reg 18 draft published Feb 2025). This emerging plan focuses on meeting housing needs within urban areas and selected expansions of towns like Yate, while collaborating with Bristol on urban edge sites. Until this new plan is adopted (likely ~2025/26), the council relies on the 2013/2014 plans. Those are out-of-date in parts: for instance, housing targets were lower than current need and some intended strategic sites (like Buckover) did not proceed, leaving a gap. Nonetheless, South Glos has maintained a five-year supply by stepping up delivery on other sites and approving additional housing in certain villages under flexible policies. This has so far prevented widespread speculative development—though a few appeals have succeeded by citing unmet need, especially for affordable housing. The risk will heighten if adoption of the new plan is delayed, as the urban extension sites from the old plan will mostly complete by late 2020s, and without new allocations supply could dip. The council has mitigated short-term risk by approving interim housing on some safeguarded lands around settlements. Once the new plan is in place, with updated allocations (possibly including a reduced version of a new settlement near Thornbury or expanded Yate), the policy situation will stabilize. In summary, while the current plan is outdated, South Glos has managed to control development via careful interim measures and is on the cusp of adopting a replacement plan, keeping plan-led risk at a moderate level in this transitional period.",

    "notes": "South Hams (outside the Dartmoor National Park) is covered by the Plymouth & South West Devon Joint Local Plan 2014–2034, adopted March 2019. This joint plan with Plymouth and West Devon allocates major growth primarily in Plymouth’s urban fringe (some of which falls in South Hams, such as at Woolwell) and in a new town at Sherford (straddling the South Hams-Plymouth border). For the rural parts of South Hams, the plan focuses on meeting local needs in towns like Dartmouth, Kingsbridge, and Ivybridge, while protecting the AONB coast. This plan is current and has proven effective: Sherford new community is under construction (with hundreds of homes occupied and ultimately ~5,500 planned), and smaller allocations in the market towns are coming forward with appropriate infrastructure. South Hams can demonstrate a comfortable five-year supply (bolstered by Sherford’s trajectory). As such, the tilted balance does not apply. The Councils have committed to monitor the plan and formally consider by 2024 whether a review is needed – this was done and it was concluded the strategy remains sound, so a full review was not immediately triggered. Barring significant changes (e.g., if Plymouth’s needs increase or a new environmental constraint emerges), the joint plan will likely remain in force until around 2029 when a new plan will be prepared. Therefore, South Hams currently faces low plan-related risks: the joint plan framework ensures development is plan-led, and speculative proposals outside identified settlements have largely been dismissed on appeal due to the strong housing land position and up-to-date policies. In summary, South Hams’ planning is stable under the adopted joint plan, and it remains one of the better examples of effective cross-border planning delivering growth and thus minimizing the risk of unplanned development.",

    "notes": "South Holland (with Boston) adopted the South East Lincolnshire Local Plan 2011-2036 in 2019. This joint plan allocates significant housing and employment growth to Spalding (including urban extensions and a relief road), Holbeach, and a number of villages, and also safeguards a route for the Spalding Western Relief Road to support new development. Since adoption, South Holland has seen steady progress: housing delivery has been on target with numerous sites in Spalding and Holbeach building out. The plan also coordinated with infrastructure like upgrades to the A16 and flood mitigation in the Fens. With the plan only 6 years in, its policies are current and effective – for example, the council has successfully used them to refuse ad hoc developments in unsustainable locations, defending appeals by pointing to the allocated sites pipeline. The area has a healthy five-year supply; indeed, South Holland has a surplus of potential housing land, partially because some expected major employment projects (like a possible food enterprise zone expansion) didn’t need all the housing originally anticipated. There is no pressing need to review the plan yet, though a review will likely start around 2025 to plan beyond 2036 and incorporate updated growth forecasts (e.g., any impact from the Peterborough economy or from improved road links). Until then, South Holland’s planning remains firmly plan-led under the joint plan. The tilted balance is not engaged, speculative proposals are generally declining because developers prefer the certainty of allocated sites, and the council can focus on implementation – such as ensuring infrastructure commitments like new schools in the urban extensions are delivered timely. In short, South Holland’s Local Plan is robust and up-to-date, keeping development on track and risk low.",

The 2015 plan was sufficient until recently, but as its allocations build out, Swindon needs the new plan (with additional sites and updated policies) to avoid future land supply gaps. Currently, supply remains decent and the plan delay hasn’t yet led to severe speculative pressure.",
    "notes": "Swindon’s 2015 Local Plan (to 2026) enabled large urban extensions like Wichelstowe, Kingsdown, and New Eastern Villages (NEV), totalling over 20,000 homes. These projects are well underway: Wichelstowe and parts of NEV have homes occupied and infrastructure (like the Wichelstowe Southern Access) delivered. As such, Swindon’s housing delivery has been strong. However, the plan’s end date looms and some later phases (e.g., the rest of NEV and Kingsdown) will extend beyond 2026. The Council prepared a Local Plan Review (to 2036) and submitted it in April 2022. Examination was paused at the council’s request in Sept 2022, likely due to awaiting clarity on government planning reforms and to consider higher housing numbers. As of late 2023, the examination is set to resume with Main Modifications. If all goes well, adoption could occur by mid-2024. During this pause, Swindon has fortunately maintained about a 5-year supply, thanks to the continued build-out of the big allocations. Thus, the tilted balance has been mostly avoided, although the Council has faced pressure to approve some additional small sites to keep supply on track (e.g., a recent appeal for 70 homes on a non-allocated site was allowed, citing looming shortfalls). The risk will rise if the new plan were further delayed because by late decade many allocated sites will be complete, and without new ones, supply would drop. The emerging plan adds some new allocations (including expanding some existing sites and possibly a new village at Redlands Airfield) to top up supply. Given Swindon’s track record of proactive planning, it’s likely to get the plan over the line soon, minimizing any gap. In essence, while the 2015 plan is aging, Swindon hasn’t yet hit a crisis due to the strategic sites carrying it through. Plan risk is moderate; timely adoption of the new plan will ensure Swindon can transition seamlessly and continue its major growth projects (like completing NEV) without a policy vacuum.",

Swale risks supply shortfalls without a new plan, and its ability to resist new proposals is weakening – the borough needs to resume the plan process to avoid falling into a tilted balance scenario again.",
    "notes": "Swale’s 2017 Local Plan (“Bearing Fruits 2031”) allocated large urban extensions around Sittingbourne and Faversham, many of which are now completed or nearly. The Borough saw strong housing delivery in the late 2010s as those sites progressed, but by 2021, to keep pace with rising targets (~1,100 homes/yr under standard method), Swale launched a Local Plan Review. A Regulation 19 draft in 2021 proposed further major allocations, including a new garden village at South East Faversham (~2,500 homes). However, following local elections in 2022, the new council leadership pulled back the plan amid objections to so much growth, and it sought to challenge national housing numbers. As a result, examination of the 2021 draft never occurred. Now in 2025, Swale is without a new plan and is effectively continuing under the 2017 plan – which is out-of-date on housing (it planned for ~776/yr). The Borough’s housing land supply has dropped to barely 5 years (and likely below if using current need figures). This precarious position means the tilted balance may soon apply if it doesn’t already. In fact, several speculative proposals in villages not allocated in the 2017 plan have come forward, and some have been allowed at appeal or by officers to bolster supply. The council’s pause on the plan is supposed to reconsider locations and maybe reduce numbers, but unless policy changes nationally, Swale will eventually need to adopt a plan meeting a similar need figure. In the meantime, the lack of an updated plan creates uncertainty – developers are targeting Faversham especially, given demand and its infrastructure like the M2. Swale’s plan risk is climbing the longer the review is paused: it currently staves off worst-case by showing some supply from the 2017 allocations that are still finishing, but once those are done, without new allocations the cupboard will be bare. The council will likely have to restart the plan process in 2024 to avoid losing control entirely. In summary, Swale had achieved plan-led growth but is now at risk due to the halted review; reactivating and completing the Local Plan update is critical to regain certainty and fend off planning by appeal.",

Until adoption, Surrey Heath relies on the NPPF and has resorted to approving some Green Belt sites to maintain minimal supply. Plan risk is high until the new plan is in force, as unmet need remains high and the tilted balance often applies.",
    "notes": "Surrey Heath’s planning challenges mirror those of neighbors like Spelthorne and Woking – high demand, majority Green Belt/SPA, and limited urban capacity. Its Core Strategy dates to 2012, planning for just 3,240 homes (191/yr) mostly on brownfield in Camberley and Deepcut (Princess Royal Barracks redevelopment). Current need is double that, and Surrey Heath has consistently under-delivered; it has no five-year supply and failed the Housing Delivery Test (55% in 2022). A new draft Local Plan was consulted in 2022 proposing some Green Belt release (e.g., at West End and Lightwater) and increased densities in Camberley, aiming to meet roughly 80% of need, with the rest possibly unmet or to be exported. This faced local opposition, contributing to delays. The plan was submitted in Dec 2024. Meanwhile, with the 2012 plan obsolete, the tilted balance is essentially in effect. The Council has taken the pragmatic approach of permitting a number of out-of-plan sites – including a large one at Fairoaks (previously a draft new settlement idea) for housing under very special circumstances – to reduce short-term pressure. Still, housing delivery remains low and speculative proposals can cite the lack of a plan. Appeals in recent years have forced Surrey Heath to allow extra housing on Green Belt and within 5 km of the Thames Basin Heaths SPA beyond what its old plan allowed, just to try to meet need. Until the new plan is adopted (likely in 2025), the borough will continue to face this balancing act. Plan risk is high because without an adopted strategy, Surrey Heath has limited grounds to refuse developments that can argue they’re the only way to address housing need (subject to Habitats regs compliance for the SPA). If the new plan is adopted with agreed growth allocations, that will significantly strengthen the Council’s hand by clearly delineating where development should go (and SANG solutions for SPA mitigation). Thus, the next 1-2 years are critical: the longer the plan is not in place, the more developers may push the envelope. Surrey Heath’s situation, like others in west Surrey, underscores the tension between Green Belt protection and unmet housing need in the absence of an up-to-date plan.",

With the Allocations Plan adoption expected in late 2023, all pieces will be in place, keeping speculative development in check and risk low.",
    "notes": "Sunderland’s Core Strategy and Development Plan (CSDP) was adopted in January 2020, setting out the strategic framework to 2033. It released some areas from the otherwise tight Green Belt, notably for the South Sunderland Growth Area (around Ryhope) with 3,000 homes and for an urban extension at Chapelgarth. The CSDP also established employment growth zones like the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) by Nissan, a joint project with South Tyneside. Since adoption, these strategic sites have progressed - Chapelgarth is under construction, and IAMP is delivering large manufacturing units. Sunderland has thus been able to demonstrate a robust five-year supply and has not faced significant challenges to its plan strategy. A secondary part, the Allocations and Designations Plan, which allocates smaller sites and town centre uses, has been at examination through 2023 and is expected to be adopted by early 2024. This will fully replace the remaining saved UDP policies. Because the strategy plan is recent and the allocations plan is almost complete, Sunderland’s policy suite is essentially up-to-date. The city is meeting its housing targets (around 745 homes/year) primarily through regeneration and planned urban extensions, so the tilted balance is not engaged. One area of note: like many cities, Sunderland aims to increase city centre living (the Riverside Sunderland masterplan), and the plan provides supportive policies for that, which are being used to guide consents for new city centre apartments. With the near-finalization of the Allocations Plan, Sunderland will have a complete, modern local plan, placing it in a very strong position to manage development effectively through to the 2030s. Therefore, plan risk in Sunderland is low - it has embraced plan-making and followed through, insulating itself from speculative development and ensuring that growth (including any necessary Green Belt changes) is addressed via the local plan process rather than by appeal.",

In the interim, housing supply has been tight – Stroud narrowly avoided tilted balance by using reserve sites. Once the new plan (with additional allocations including a new town at Wisloe) is adopted, plan-led control will be secure; until then risk is moderate but managed.",
    "notes": "Stroud’s Local Plan 2006-2031 was adopted in November 2015, focusing growth on strategic sites like North East Cam (Cambridge), Hunts Grove (south of Gloucester), and an eco-village at Sharpness. By the early 2020s, several of these sites were completed or well advanced, and Stroud began running low on readily available housing land. The Council prepared a Local Plan Review (up to 2040) with new allocations (notably a proposed new settlement at Wisloe near Slimbridge for 1,500 homes and an expanded growth area at Sharpness for 2,400 homes). This review was **submitted in October 2021. Examination has been lengthy, partly due to objections to Wisloe and infrastructure questions; Main Modifications were consulted in mid-2023, suggesting the inspector supports most of the plan with some reductions in Sharpness new town scale and phasing changes. Adoption is expected by early 2024. During this gap, Stroud managed to maintain just over a five-year supply by approving some “contingency” sites from its 2015 plan and a couple of additional edge-of-settlement schemes to prevent shortfall. It thus avoided the tilted balance scenario (though it was close – at one point supply was around 5.2 years). Appeals have generally been dismissed as the pending new allocations carry weight and the short-term need is being met. Once the new plan is adopted, Stroud will have a refreshed land supply pipeline likely pushing its five-year supply well above requirement (Wisloe and other sites will count). That will firmly shut the door on speculative arguments. Therefore, current plan risk is moderate and diminishing: the Council navigated the latter stages of the old plan without major unplanned approvals, and the imminent new plan will restore complete plan-led confidence. The key will be promptly implementing the new allocations, particularly delivering Wisloe Garden Village with necessary transport improvements, to ensure the housing trajectory stays on track. Provided that happens, Stroud’s planning position will be strong, moving from a slightly precarious period into a secure new plan era.",

    "notes": "Stratford-on-Avon’s 2011-2031 Core Strategy was adopted in July 2016. It delivered significant growth: notably, the Long Marston Airfield Garden Village (3,500 homes) was allocated and is in early phases, a large urban extension at Gaydon/Lighthorne Heath (now the new village of Upper Lighthorne) to meet adjacent Warwick District’s need is underway, plus dispersed housing and employment across many villages and Stratford-upon-Avon town. By 2023, many of these allocations are progressing or complete – Stratford has maintained healthy delivery and a five-year land supply. However, being five+ years since adoption and with most strategic sites spoken for, focus turned to planning beyond 2031. Stratford District teamed up with neighbouring Warwick District to create a South Warwickshire Joint Plan looking to 2050; an Issues consultation ran in 2020. This plan will likely incorporate the remaining long-term phase of Long Marston and potentially another new settlement or major expansion, as well as economic growth tied to the M40 corridor. Until this joint plan is adopted (target around 2025/26), Stratford’s 2016 plan remains the operative framework. It’s somewhat outdated (e.g., it didn't foresee all climate change policy shifts or the full extent of housing pressures), but crucially the district can still show a sufficient supply and has not been subject to aggressive speculative proposals – partly because the 2016 plan comprehensively allocated a lot of land including reserve sites. The risk of “planning by appeal” is relatively low at the moment; appeals have generally been decided in line with the existing plan (one exception was an allowed appeal for 210 homes at Alderminster in 2021, where the inspector weighed housing need, but that was before Upper Lighthorne got fully underway). The main risk is if the joint plan stalls, by late 2020s Stratford could start to run short on developable land and then face more speculative pressure, especially given Coventry and Birmingham’s overspill could redirect toward South Warwickshire. For now, though, the Council is bridging the gap with supplementary planning guidance and focusing on securing delivery of allocated sites. Overall, moderate risk – well-managed currently but dependent on timely progression of the South Warwickshire Plan to ensure the next wave of growth is plan-led.",

A new Stoke Local Plan 2020–2040 is in preparation (Reg18 draft 2022) after joint planning with Newcastle-under-Lyme was abandoned. The city has focused on urban regeneration, but housing delivery has lagged targets and suburban extensions are needed. Without an updated plan yet, Stoke faces a partial policy vacuum – though lower market pressure has limited speculative sprawl, the council is eager to adopt a new plan by 2025 to reestablish full control.",
    "notes": "Stoke-on-Trent’s last comprehensive plan was the Joint Core Strategy 2006-2026 with Newcastle-under-Lyme, adopted in 2009, plus a 2013 Stoke City Centre/Inner Urban Plan. These are out-of-date now. Stoke and Newcastle started a new Joint Local Plan around 2017 but progress stalled and in 2022 each decided to do separate plans (as Newcastle moved faster). Stoke published a Preferred Options in late 2022 for its own Local Plan 2020-2040. Stoke’s strategy remains regeneration-heavy – focusing development into the urban core and existing suburbs, and seeking to avoid large-scale Green Belt release on its fringes (unlike Newcastle which has released some Green Belt for housing). However, Stoke has struggled with low viability in parts of the city, resulting in under-delivery of housing (especially compared to its need of ~600 homes/yr). The old plan’s targets were modest and often unmet; thus, by NPPF measures, Stoke lacks a five-year supply and the tilted balance could apply. In reality, market interest in speculative greenfield development in Stoke is limited (due to its post-industrial economic challenges), so the absence of an updated plan hasn’t led to a flood of rogue planning applications as seen in some southern districts. Most development continues on brownfield via Council intervention (e.g., the City Council partnering to build homes in Burslem, etc.). Nonetheless, to secure long-term growth – including any more prosperous outer areas – the new Local Plan is crucial. It likely will allocate some sustainable urban extensions (e.g., around Trentham Lakes or Meir) to ensure a pipeline of deliverable sites with viability, while continuing to push brownfield (a new housing zone near the railway station is proposed). Until the new plan is adopted (target 2025), Stoke remains somewhat in limbo: it uses the old strategy for decision rationale but often has to rely on NPPF directly for housing supply justification. Plan risk is moderate: the lack of high developer pressure mitigates immediate risk of unplanned large sites, but on the flip side means Stoke must proactively zone land to attract investment (or else stagnation continues). The new plan’s adoption and execution will be key to breaking that cycle – providing certainty and incentives (through site allocations and possibly relaxed policies in growth areas) to spur the housing market. In sum, Stoke needs its new plan to regain momentum, but in the meantime the outdated plan hasn’t caused chaos, just a slow pace of development.",

    "notes": "Stockton-on-Tees adopted its Local Plan 2017-2032 in January 2019, replacing a 2010 Core Strategy. The plan sets out significant housing allocations including a Western Extension to Stockton, ongoing development at Wynyard Garden Village, and regeneration in Stockton and Thornaby town centres. It also allocates large employment sites along the A19 corridor (e.g., growth at Durham Lane Industrial Park). Since adoption, Stockton has maintained strong housing delivery – often exceeding its annual target (around 720 units/year) thanks to progress at Wynyard and market sites in Yarm and Eaglescliffe. With this up-to-date plan, the Council has a robust five-year supply and clear policy basis to determine applications. It has generally been successful in defending against proposals outside the plan; few appeals have challenged the plan given its recency. Notably, Stockton was able to incorporate flexibility for the Teesside Airport area via the plan and supportive policies for catalytic projects like the new freeport, thus adapting well to changing economic initiatives. As of 2025, there is no immediate need to review the plan – it’s performing well, and the borough has capacity into the late 2020s without issue. A review might commence around 2026 to extend beyond 2032, possibly to adjust for any new economic growth surges (e.g., if net zero industries on Teesworks lead to significant in-migration). But that would be a proactive update, not due to any failure of the existing plan. Plan risk is low: Stockton’s development is firmly plan-led under the 2019 framework, the tilted balance does not apply, and stakeholders have certainty. The focus remains on implementation – such as delivering the Stockton Waterfront regeneration – under the guidance of the adopted plan, with any new opportunities or needs to be captured in a timely future review.",

Adoption is hoped for 2025.

    "notes": "Stockport’s planning policy gap has been a significant Greater Manchester outlier. Its Core Strategy 2011 and 2006 UDP are outdated, especially as the borough’s housing need is very high (~1,000 homes/yr) but it has insisted on protecting most of its Green Belt. Stockport pulled out of the GM “Places for Everyone” joint plan process in 2020 specifically to avoid mandated Green Belt release for housing, opting to make a local plan instead. However, preparing its own plan has taken time: a first full draft was consulted on in 2023, which does finally propose some Green Belt release (around 5% of Stockport’s Green Belt) to provide for about 5,000 homes – still short of the need, but Stockport hopes to argue exceptional circumstances. The plan is not yet at examination. Meanwhile, development in Stockport has been predominantly apartments in the town centre and some mills converted – not enough to meet targets. The Council currently cannot demonstrate a five-year housing land supply; its delivery test results are low. Thus, the tilted balance is in effect. Interestingly, the lack of available non-Green Belt sites has meant fewer major housing proposals (developers see planning risk), but it’s led to appeals for smaller infills being harder to refuse. Also, unmet need from Stockport is spilling over: Cheshire East has seen appeals where developers cite Stockport’s shortfall as justification for building near the border. Stockport is at risk of “planning by appeal” if it doesn’t get a new plan in place: pressure is mounting from government and the development sector to address its housing issues. The new local plan aims to be submitted in 2024 and adopted by 2025; if successful, it will finally allocate specific Green Belt parcels and brownfield intensification areas, providing a defensible strategy. Until then, Stockport lives in a delicate state – trying to encourage as much brownfield development as possible (including via the Mayoral Development Corporation in central Stockport) to compensate, and hoping to fend off major unwanted proposals (so far, it has avoided any massive appeal losses for Green Belt, but that luck may not hold indefinitely). Plan risk remains high, but with a potential end in sight if the local plan proceeds to adoption.",

A review will be needed by 2024, but likely will roll forward without issues given strong performance.",
    "notes": "The Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031 was adopted in May 2019, after overcoming a government holding direction due to Green Belt release at Stevenage’s edge. The plan allocates around 7,600 homes, including a major urban extension at Stevenage West (around 1,350 homes on former Green Belt), and promotes comprehensive town centre regeneration (with mixed-use redevelopment of ageing shopping precincts). Since adoption, Stevenage has seen a marked uptick in development: multiple town centre high-rise residential schemes have broken ground (at Queensway, etc.), and the first phases of Stevenage West have detailed permission aligning with the new infrastructure (schools, roads) schedule. The plan’s policies are current and effective in negotiating good outcomes (e.g., high affordable housing percentages on brownfield sites). The council can demonstrate a five-year supply comfortably due to these allocations coming forward. Thus, the tilted balance does not apply; rather, decisions are firmly per the local plan. Because the plan was adopted under the 2012 NPPF, it committed to an early review – due by 2024 – to align with later household projections. However, given Stevenage’s successful delivery and the fact that a large chunk of its need is met by the plan (and some unmet need is reliant on North Herts), the urgency of a full review is mild. The Council is expected to commence a modest update in 2024/25 mainly to extend the plan to 2040 and adjust any allocations if needed (possibly increasing town centre capacity further given high demand for station-adjacent living). Meanwhile, the adopted plan gives it strong ground to refuse developments outside planned areas (no significant appeals of that nature have occurred since 2019). Plan risk is thus low – Stevenage is in an enviable position of active growth entirely within a plan-led framework. Keeping the momentum will just require the timely planned review and continued partnership with North Herts for any cross-boundary issues.",

With this fresh plan, St Helens has ample land supply and clear policies, significantly lowering development risk and ending a long period of defaulting to the presumption due to earlier plan gaps.",
    "notes": "After operating on a 2012 Core Strategy and encountering issues with five-year supply (leading to several appeal losses around 2018), St Helens now has an adopted Local Plan 2020-2037 as of July 2022. This plan took bold steps to boost growth: it released Green Belt for two strategic employment sites (Parkside – a former colliery earmarked for a rail freight interchange, and Omega South – an extension of the Warrington logistics park spilling into St Helens) and for several urban extensions delivering about 2,200 homes (notably at Bold Forest Garden Suburb and around Garswood). With this plan in place, St Helens is planning for around 10,000 new homes and substantial job creation by 2037. Already, we see implementation: planning applications for Parkside Phase 1 and Bold are approved, and housing developers are moving onto allocated sites rather than speculating elsewhere. The plan is up-to-date, so the Council is firmly in control – it can point developers to allocated opportunities and has strong policy to refuse developments outside them. The housing land supply is healthy (the plan front-loaded some sites to address earlier undersupply, so a five-year supply exists again). The previous era – where St Helens lacked allocations and had to grant large schemes on appeal (like Florida Farm warehouse park) – is over. There is no need for an immediate review; the council will likely focus on delivery and monitoring for a few years. Plan risk is thus low: the main things to manage are ensuring infrastructure (like new roads at Bold and Parkside rail connection) keeps pace, but those are built into the plan conditions. Unplanned development pressure has essentially evaporated now that the plan provides clear direction and confidence to investors about where to go. St Helens’ example shows how adopting a long-delayed plan has moved it from a high-risk footing (constant tilted balance in early 2020s) to a low-risk, plan-led regime in 2025.",

The plan is delivering, with recent permissions in towns, so the council has control of development and no immediate need to review yet.",
    "notes": "The Staffordshire Moorlands Local Plan was adopted in September 2020, replacing an earlier Core Strategy. This plan allocates around 6000 homes to 2033, primarily in the three market towns: Leek (with several greenfield extensions), Biddulph (with a contentious but approved Green Belt release at Gillow Heath), and Cheadle (urban extensions). It took a while to adopt due to debates over those Green Belt revisions, but since adoption, the District has moved to implementation. Many housing sites in Leek and Cheadle have planning permission or are going through, and a larger mixed-use allocation at Biddulph is in progress with infrastructure planning. Being only a few years old, the plan’s policies are up-to-date (including those on the Peak District fringe and town centre regeneration) and the Council can robustly use them to guide decisions. Staffordshire Moorlands has a five-year land supply (it slightly dipped in 2021 but recovered after the plan adoption unlocked sites). Therefore, the tilted balance is not engaged; indeed appeals have been decided in the council’s favor post-2020 citing the adopted allocations. There is no rush for a plan review; likely around 2025 they will begin considering extending the plan beyond 2033, but given modest growth pressure and some headroom in current allocations (some towns haven’t taken all identified capacity yet), plan risk is low. One watchpoint is if any major site fails to deliver (e.g., if a large Leek site stalled, that could temporarily affect supply, but so far so good). Additionally, the plan relies on Stoke-on-Trent’s urban area taking some demand (for Biddulph), but collaborative work with Stoke ensures alignment. Overall, with a current plan in place, Staffordshire Moorlands enjoys a stable planning environment – development is happening as planned and speculative development outside settlement boundaries is generally deterred by the valid framework. The next plan update in a few years will further strengthen continuity, but at present the planning risks are minimal.",

The existing plan has served well, but housing supply is tightening as sites build out, raising the importance of an updated plan to avoid falling into presumption by the later 2020s.",
    "notes": "The Plan for Stafford Borough 2011-2031 was adopted in June 2014 (Part 2 in 2017). It allocated major sustainable urban extensions north and west of Stafford town (around 5,000 homes in total), an extension at Stone, and several new settlements (e.g., Meecebrook was considered but not allocated; instead, modest village expansions were included). Over the last decade, Stafford has seen these sites progress well – thousands of homes have been delivered in the new communities of Marston Grange, Burleyfields, etc., and Stafford’s employment areas (e.g., Redhill business park) have been successful. As of 2023, the borough has largely met its core strategy targets, and while it maintains a five-year supply, that surplus is eroding as the plan heads towards its end date. Recognizing this, the Council is working on a new Local Plan 2020-2040, with a Preferred Option consulted in 2022. This new plan likely includes a Meecebrook Garden Community (about 3,000 homes near Cold Meece, leveraging HS2’s proximity) as well as further growth at Stafford and perhaps Stone. However, the new plan is not expected to be adopted until 2024/25. In the interim, the 2014 plan is aging but still mostly effective – appeals are generally dismissed as the council can show a supply and an active plan review in train. The risk will heighten if adoption drags on and the existing allocations near full completion, which could cause a supply gap. Moreover, without the new plan, ad hoc proposals for a garden village or large logistics parks (Stafford’s location on the M6 makes it a target for warehousing) might come forward outside the plan, though the Council has resisted these so far. The window for risk is relatively short: if the new plan proceeds on schedule, the borough should smoothly transition to a new strategy without a tilted balance scenario. Thus, current plan risk is moderate and mostly tied to timing – the quicker the new allocations (like Meecebrook) are confirmed and can count towards supply, the more Stafford secures its plan-led approach for the future.",

The plan adoption is now delayed, prolonging reliance on a 2009 strategy that doesn’t meet NPPF tests – hence Spelthorne is often subject to the tilted balance and at high risk of speculative proposals until the new plan is resolved.",
    "notes": "Spelthorne’s situation epitomizes plan-making difficulties in constrained boroughs. Its 2009 Core Strategy set a very low housing target (~166 homes/yr) suited to a then largely built-out borough, with almost all open land designated Green Belt. Modern assessments show a need of 600+ homes/yr. The Council prepared a new Local Plan to try to meet about 80-85% of that need by releasing a few Green Belt parcels (e.g., sites at Staines and Sunbury) while still relying on high-density redevelopments in Staines town centre. This plan was controversial locally for its Green Belt proposals; it was submitted in November 2022 and examination hearings began mid-2023. However, after local elections, the new administration attempted to withdraw the plan in summer 2023 – the Planning Inspectorate paused examination while legal advice was sought. Ultimately the Council in late 2023 decided to continue with examination, but this process has delayed potential adoption to late 2024 or 2025. In the interim, Spelthorne’s planning vacuum persists. The 2009 strategy is far from meeting current needs; indeed, Spelthorne has delivered well below its requirement for years and is regularly failing the Housing Delivery Test. The tilted balance has been invoked repeatedly by developers, and appeals have succeeded (one notable case allowed housing on a Green Belt site in Stanwell in 2021, with the Inspector citing the acute shortfall as very special circumstances). The Council has also taken the unusual step of effectively halting new major housing permissions pending the plan outcome, but that runs the risk of more appeals. Overall, without an adopted new plan, Spelthorne is at high risk of planning by appeal – caught between protecting Green Belt and needing housing. Every refusal on unmet-need grounds is challengeable. If the new plan is adopted in 2024/25 with its allocations, that will greatly firm up the Council’s position by showing how needs will be met, thus removing the justification for speculative non-plan proposals. Until then, Spelthorne remains in a precarious position, trying to defend an out-of-date plan in one of the most housing-pressured parts of the country.",

The new plan is urgently needed to allocate deliverable sites (potentially including some Green Belt changes) to regain plan-led control.",
    "notes": "South Tyneside’s planning policy is effectively operating on a 2007 Core Strategy and saved UDP policies from 1999. The Council has struggled for over a decade to progress a new plan; attempts in the mid-2010s stalled. Consequently, the borough has had no up-to-date land allocations, and development has been largely reactive – focused on regenerating former industrial sites along the Tyne (e.g., Holborn Riverside) and small infill. The housing need in South Tyneside (around 350-400 homes/yr) has not been met; the Council has repeatedly undershot its requirement and thus the presumption in favor of development is effectively triggered. In practice, South Tyneside’s dense urban character means there haven’t been large greenfield speculative proposals (most open land is Green Belt along the borough’s fringes). However, it has missed opportunities to direct growth strategically – many young families have simply moved out to neighboring areas due to lack of new housing estates in South Tyneside. The Council finally pulled together a Draft Local Plan for 2016–2036, which includes some Green Belt releases (for example, around Boldon) and a focus on town centre living in South Shields. This plan was **submitted in March 2025. If adopted by 2026, it will allocate sufficient sites to meet needs and provide clear development management policies (e.g., on design and the coastal zone) that align with current NPPF. Until then, decision-making remains heavily reliant on the NPPF and tilted balance: the Council often has to approve borderline schemes to avoid appeals, given its lack of five-year supply. One recent instance saw the Council approve homes on a safeguarded open space, citing housing need. This underscores the high-risk situation – balancing community desires to protect green areas against the imperative to show progress on housing. The forthcoming plan is critical to resolve this tension by explicitly designating what greenfield can be sacrificed and what is sacrosanct.

    "notes": "South Staffordshire is a rural Green Belt district bordering the West Midlands conurbation. Its 2012 Core Strategy and 2018 Site Allocations focused on modest growth in villages and new employment sites along the M54/M6 corridor. Since then, the District has been under pressure to help meet the Greater Birmingham housing shortfall. The Council prepared a new Local Plan Review (2018–2037) with proposals for around 4,000 new homes, including releasing Green Belt land on the edge of the Black Country (at sites like Landywood and east of Brownhills). This plan was submitted in 2022, but examination is stalled (the Inspector flagged concerns in Oct 2023 about the scale of Green Belt release relative to demonstrated need, partly because the Black Country authorities withdrew their joint plan) – the examination is effectively on hold pending more evidence or regional agreement. This leaves South Staffs in limbo: the 2012 plan is obsolete (it did not account for any major duty-to-cooperate uplift), and the new plan is delayed. Meanwhile, the district cannot show a five-year supply against current need figures; it has openly acknowledged a substantial shortfall. Thus, developers have been targeting Green Belt sites, arguing \"very special circumstances\" due to housing need. The Council has resisted pending the plan outcome, but appeals are likely. The tilted balance alone cannot override Green Belt designation (since Green Belt policies are protected), but the housing need adds pressure for release. Essentially, without an adopted new plan to selectively direct Green Belt release, decisions risk being made piecemeal by appeal inspectors. This is a high-risk scenario for the Council – either it gets its plan back on track (perhaps by scaling back or firming up the evidence for its allocations and getting it adopted in 2024/25), or it faces potentially losing control of where and how Green Belt is breached. In the interim, South Staffs has leaned on temporary measures like a 2020 Memorandum of Understanding with the West Midlands on housing apportionment, but that’s tenuous after the Black Country plan collapse. Until the Local Plan is resolved, the district’s development management is precariously balanced between unmet needs and Green Belt protection, making it one of the more vulnerable planning situations currently.",

Yeovil and market towns have seen growth from the 2015 plan, but key sites (like the urban extension) lagged, causing some housing shortfall. Until Somerset’s new unitary plan addresses this, South Somerset relies on the old policies and often the NPPF presumption to decide applications.",
    "notes": "The South Somerset Local Plan 2006-2028 was adopted in March 2015 after a partial withdrawal and re-examination (the Yeovil Sustainable Urban Extension was re-evaluated at that time). It set a strategy focusing major growth at Yeovil (including an urban extension of around 1,500 homes), and significant allocations at market towns like Chard, Wincanton, and Crewkerne. While many housing sites in Yeovil and other towns have been built, some strategic projects (Chard’s urban extension with relief road, and the Yeovil extension) have progressed slowly or stalled. By the late 2010s, South Somerset struggled to maintain a five-year supply, dipping to about 4 years at worst, which triggered the tilted balance in a number of appeal decisions. The Council had begun a Local Plan Review with Issues consultation in 2020 to plan to 2040, but with local government reorganization, that work ceased and will fold into the new Somerset-wide plan eventually. Now under Somerset Council, the South Somerset area still uses the 2015 plan policies – which are outdated, especially on housing numbers (based on old targets). Consequently, decisions in 2023-2024 have often had to lean on NPPF para.11(d). For instance, some speculative proposals on Yeovil’s edge or in rural settlements have been allowed to make up for the lagging strategic sites. The risk here is relatively high until a new plan allocates alternative or additional sites to meet the shortfall. However, the recent uptick in housing delivery (South Somerset approved many homes in the past couple of years to address the deficit) means the five-year supply is improving, which should help mitigate presumption issues in the short term. Still, without an updated plan beyond 2028, the area lacks a forward strategy for growth, affordable housing, and infrastructure planning (especially important as Yeovil’s economy diversifies post-AgustaWestland). The forthcoming Somerset Council Local Plan will need to identify new solutions – possibly a new settlement along the A303 corridor or bolstering growth at stronger market towns – to pick up where the 2015 plan leaves off. Until then, South Somerset remains vulnerable to ad hoc development driven by the absence of an up-to-date local framework.",

A new Central Lancs Local Plan is in advanced drafting (Publication Feb 2025), which will replace the 2012 strategy by 2025. The current framework, while dated, has largely held thanks to inter-authority coordination.",
    "notes": "South Ribble shares the **Central Lancashire Core Strategy 2012 with Preston and Chorley, and has its own Local Plan (Sites & Development Management) adopted in 2015. Together, these guided significant growth in South Ribble, notably the Buckshaw Village new town (joint with Chorley) and major employment expansion at Cuerden (Lancashire Central). By late 2010s, housing delivery across Central Lancs was running ahead of plan, leading to debates on whether the Core Strategy’s housing requirement was still applicable. To avoid speculative appeals exploiting “outdated” figures, the Central Lancs authorities agreed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2020 to use increased housing targets and apportion them – effectively staving off the tilted balance argument successfully in recent appeals. South Ribble has consistently maintained over 5 years supply under these higher numbers. Meanwhile, the councils have been working on a new Central Lancashire Local Plan (2023-2038), with a Publication Draft issued in Feb 2025 (for submission later in 2025). For South Ribble, the new plan will allocate further growth likely around Penwortham and Leyland (building on the success of Buckshaw and new infrastructure like the Penwortham bypass), and refresh employment land supply to capitalize on the Preston City Deal. Until this new plan is adopted (expected by 2025/26), South Ribble’s development management relies on the 2012/2015 plans plus the agreed interim housing requirement approach. This has so far prevented major unplanned developments – most applications are coming on allocated or brownfield urban sites. The risk of plan-led control loss is moderate: if the new plan were significantly delayed or one of the partner councils diverged from the MoU, tilted balance issues could re-emerge. However, the joint working has been strong and is on track to deliver the updated plan. In essence, while South Ribble’s formal plan is “old,” proactive cooperation and buffer in land supply have kept speculative development at bay, and with a new local plan imminent, the borough’s planning risk is being managed effectively.",

It runs to 2035. The district is now working jointly with Vale of White Horse on a new combined plan to 2041, submitted in Dec 2024. The current plan remains effective in guiding growth, so risk of unplanned development is low.",
    "notes": "After a controversial process, South Oxfordshire’s Local Plan 2011-2035 was adopted in December 2020. It allocates significant housing growth, including a strategic new community at Chalgrove Airfield (3,000 homes, though this has faced delivery uncertainties due to Ministry of Defence land issues) and major expansions at Didcot (Garden Town) and around Thame and Wallingford. The plan was imposed with high housing targets to assist Oxford City’s unmet need (South Oxon agreed to take ~4,000 of Oxford’s overflow). With adoption, the plan is up-to-date and the Council has been granting permissions accordingly – Didcot’s Valley Park and Culham sites are moving ahead, for example. The district currently can demonstrate a five-year supply, bolstered by these strategic sites in the pipeline (though Chalgrove’s timing is still in question, alternative sites can backfill if needed). To look beyond 2035 and cement cooperation, South Oxfordshire is now preparing a Joint Local Plan 2041 with Vale of White Horse District; that joint plan was submitted for examination in Dec 2024. Until the new joint plan is adopted (likely 2025/26), the 2020 plan continues to apply and is largely sufficient. There have been few successful speculative proposals since adoption – developers know large commitments are already in place and the Council can robustly refuse departures (backed by the SoS’s firm stance in getting this plan through). The main risk factor is if any big allocation falters (e.g., if Chalgrove ultimately cannot proceed, the council might lack a portion of supply in the late 2020s). However, the emerging joint plan is poised to adjust for that by possibly identifying contingency growth areas. In summary, the present Local Plan gives South Oxfordshire a strong grip on development – the tilted balance is not currently in play – and with the proactive step of a joint plan underway, the district’s planning framework is in a good position, minimizing risk of unwanted speculative development.",

South Norfolk also has a separate Village Clusters plan in progress. The planning framework is sound, with ample housing sites (including the new settlement at Hethel) identified, so speculative development risk is low.",
    "notes": "South Norfolk’s strategic planning is now covered by the Greater Norwich Local Plan 2018–2038, which was adopted in January 2022 (except for one deferred site). This joint plan with Broadland and Norwich updated the earlier Joint Core Strategy (2011). For South Norfolk, it means allocations for major growth around the Norwich fringe (e.g., at Cringleford, Hethersett), expansion of market towns like Wymondham and Long Stratton (where a bypass is planned alongside housing), and a new settlement at Hethel later in the plan period. Additionally, South Norfolk is finalizing a separate Village Clusters plan (to manage small-scale housing in rural villages) due in 2024. With this comprehensive framework, South Norfolk has an up-to-date plan and a healthy land supply; it can comfortably demonstrate more than five years’ worth of deliverable sites, given the many allocations and broad distribution of growth. The Council is therefore well-armed to resist proposals contrary to the plan – indeed, appeals for unplanned large sites have dropped post-GNLP adoption. The tilted balance isn’t engaged, since housing delivery in Greater Norwich has been meeting targets. As of now, no immediate plan review is required (the GNLP will be reviewed by 2027 per policy but likely only minor tweaks). The only slight risk factor is ensuring infrastructure keeps pace (the Long Stratton bypass is key to unlocking allocated homes there – any delay could bottleneck those allocations, but contingency sites exist elsewhere if needed). Overall, South Norfolk’s planning regime is robust: the area’s growth is being channeled through an up-to-date joint strategy, leaving little room or incentive for speculative development.",

Until then, development in these areas relies on old policies and the NPPF, with modest growth continuing but some policy gaps (e.g., limited provision for newer housing needs) evident.",
    "notes": "The former South Lakeland District’s Core Strategy was adopted in 2010 and its Land Allocations in 2013. These provided for growth mainly in Kendal and Ulverston up to 2025. By 2022, South Lakeland District Council had started reviewing its plan (Issues & Options consulted) to extend to 2040, but the process paused due to the abolition of the district in 2023. Now, planning for Kendal, Ulverston, and surrounding villages falls to Westmorland & Furness Council, which will create a new unitary-wide plan (as noted, likely by 2026). In the interim, the 2010/2013 policies remain in effect. They are clearly out-of-date – for instance, housing targets were low (based on an era of constrained assumptions) and many allocated sites are built or have permission. That said, the area’s development pressure is moderate (South Lakeland’s population is relatively stable, and part of the district lies in the Lake District National Park which has its own plan). Kendal and Ulverston have seen ongoing housing development on allocated and windfall sites, sufficient so far to generally maintain a five-year supply. There have been a few instances where developers pushed for unallocated edge-of-town sites citing the aged plan, but the Council (now Westmorland & Furness) has managed to defer major decisions pending the new plan, without a flood of appeals – partly because market demand is not as intense as in commuter belts elsewhere. The main risk is that certain needs (like affordable housing for local young people or specific employment land for new industries) aren’t being fully met under the old plan’s framework. The NPPF’s tilted balance could come into play if supply slips; careful monitoring is needed. Westmorland & Furness Council will likely incorporate much of the work done by South Lakeland into its new plan (ensuring Kendal’s future expansion or Ulverston’s infrastructure are addressed coherently). In summary, while the plan for this area is outdated, the relatively modest development environment has prevented serious unmanaged growth so far. However, a modern plan is needed soon to give clarity, especially as economic initiatives (like the Britain’s Energy Coast or increased tourism) could spark development interest that the old plan wasn’t designed to handle.",

    "notes": "The South Kesteven Local Plan 2011-2036 was adopted in January 2020. It sets out significant development, notably a Garden Village at Spitalgate Heath, Grantham, urban extensions in Stamford and Bourne, and substantial housing in the market town of Grantham to support its growth as a sub-regional centre. Since adoption, the district has made progress: Grantham’s Southern Relief Road is under construction (facilitating the Spitalgate development), and housing delivery has been robust, exceeding targets. The plan is current, and the Council has a comfortable five-year land supply. Nevertheless, by policy, a review was to be considered within 5 years – the Council initiated that process with Issues & Options consultation in late 2022. The review (to plan to 2041) will consider if further sites are needed (possibly expanding the new village at Spitalgate or another at Barrowby) and update policies on climate change and design. However, progress of the review has been measured, partly due to awaiting the outcome of national planning reforms. In the meantime, the 2020 plan is solidly in force. Developers are largely focusing on the allocated sites (demand is strong in this area, including commuter demand for Peterborough and London via the A1/ECML). With supply ample, the tilted balance hasn’t been invoked in recent decisions – appeals have mostly been dismissed if not in line with the plan’s spatial strategy. One area of note: Stamford’s growth is somewhat constrained by cross-boundary issues with Rutland (which withdrew its plan in 2021), but South Kesteven’s plan has contingencies to accommodate needed growth if Rutland doesn’t. This has been managed via a Duty-to-Cooperate addendum rather than needing to re-open the plan. In summary, South Kesteven faces low planning risk: an up-to-date plan underpins decision-making, speculative development is minimal, and the Council is proactively working on a next plan to avoid any future gaps – all of which keeps development plan-led and in line with local objectives.",

A Draft Exeter Plan was published for consultation in late 2022, and by December 2024 the City Council released the Full Publication draft for the next stage of consultation. This new plan aims to allocate enough sites to accommodate around 13,500 homes by 2040, focusing on urban brownfield development and some urban extensions, in line with Exeter’s goal of sustainable growth. The Exeter Plan is expected to be submitted for examination in 2025. In the interim, because Exeter’s existing plan is out-of-date, the council must rely on the NPPF and the regional Spatial Strategy (Devon’s housing frameworks) to judge proposals. Exeter is somewhat shielded by geography – as a compact city with finite land, there have been fewer greenfield speculative applications than in more rural districts. Nonetheless, without an up-to-date plan, the council faces challenges in resisting proposals that fall outside its old policies, especially if it cannot demonstrate a five-year housing land supply. The risk will persist until the new local plan is adopted (likely by 2026). Once the Exeter Plan is in place, it will modernize the policy context, incorporate the city’s climate ambitions, and greatly reduce the current uncertainty in development management.",

The Borough Council has pursued a Core Strategy Review, which it submitted for independent examination on 30 November 2022. Examination hearings took place in mid-2024, and by September 2024 the Inspector issued a post-hearings letter indicating what modifications were needed. The review process has involved proposing updates to housing numbers and adjustments to allocations to extend the plan horizon to 2041 (renamed the Erewash Core Strategy Review 2020). As of early 2025, the Inspector’s final report is anticipated, and adoption of the reviewed plan is likely in 2025. During this transition, the 2014 Core Strategy remains the operative plan. Because it’s more than 5 years old, the NPPF’s tilted balance is engaged for housing applications, but the fact that a replacement plan is imminent gives the Council stronger grounds to resist proposals that conflict with the soon-to-be-adopted strategy.

That Core Strategy (intended to run to 2022) and a small number of later Development Management policies are still the statutory development plan. This policy vacuum has made it difficult for the council to resist speculative development, since by NPPF definition the policies are out-of-date and housing need defaults to the standard method. Recognizing this, Epsom & Ewell Borough Council has worked on a new Local Plan to address modern requirements. The new Local Plan 2022–2040 has now reached an advanced stage: a Regulation 19 Pre-Submission consultation took place over winter 2024/25, and the plan was officially submitted to the Secretary of State on 10 March 2025. An Inspector will be appointed and examination hearings are expected later in 2025. The submitted plan aims to significantly boost housing delivery (it proposes to meet a target of around 540 homes per year, including some Green Belt releases, to achieve ~10,000 new homes by 2040). While this new plan is under examination, decision-making in Epsom must still rely on the 2007/Core Strategy policies, which carry very limited weight. The tilted balance firmly applies, and indeed Epsom has seen many developments come forward in recent years that bypass local zoning due to the lack of up-to-date plan. The council’s hope is that the new Local Plan will be found sound and adopted by mid-2026, finally replacing the antiquated policies and regaining control over development. Until then, Epsom remains at high risk of unplanned projects, but the imminent prospect of an adopted plan suggests this situation could improve in the near future.",

This marked the end of a lengthy examination process that began with submission back in 2017. The delay was largely due to concerns about environmental impacts on Epping Forest Special Area of Conservation and other issues, which required extensive modifications and mitigation strategies. The adopted plan allocates significant new housing (around 11,400 homes) across the district to meet needs to 2033 and includes policies addressing those environmental constraints. Because the plan is less than five years old, Epping Forest can robustly defend planning decisions using its new policies. The council currently has a 5-year housing land supply identified in the plan, and per NPPF paragraph 75, it is exempt from needing to continually demonstrate supply until the plan is five years old. This means speculative development proposals that conflict with the plan can be refused with confidence that the presumption in favor does not override the plan. Epping Forest’s situation has thus improved dramatically since early 2023 – previously it lacked an adopted plan, but now the risk of unplanned development is low. Going forward, the council will need to commence a review by 2028, but in the near term the focus will be on delivering the allocations and infrastructure set out in the newly adopted plan.",

    "notes": "Enfield’s current Local Plan consists of a Core Strategy adopted in November 2010 and a Development Management Document from 2014. These are significantly out-of-date with respect to current London Plan targets and national policy. Recognizing this, Enfield Council has drafted a new Local Plan extending to 2041. The draft plan was submitted for examination in 2023, and the Examination in Public began with Stage 1 hearings in January 2025. The emerging plan is ambitious, proposing to meet a high housing need partly by allocating Green Belt land for development (approximately 9,000 homes on two large Green Belt sites). This has been controversial but also elicited support from the Mayor of London, who acknowledged that some Green Belt release in Enfield is “unavoidable” to meet housing demand. As the examination continues in 2025, Enfield hopes to adopt the new plan by 2025/26. In the meantime, because the 2010 Core Strategy is over 5 years old, Enfield’s housing decisions must apply the NPPF tilted balance. The borough has a substantial housing shortfall under the national standard method, and without an updated plan it has struggled to demonstrate a five-year supply. This has left Enfield vulnerable to developers—indeed, some larger schemes have come forward anticipating the new plan’s policies or exploiting the current policy gap. The plan’s advanced stage offers light at the end of the tunnel: if the Enfield Local Plan 2041 is adopted in the next year or so, it will restore a sound policy framework and significantly reduce the risk of unplanned development. Until then, Enfield’s planning authority navigates a delicate period with an aging plan but a replacement in progress, balancing development pressures against interim London Plan targets and emerging local policies.",

    "notes": "Elmbridge’s planning policy is severely out-of-date. The current Core Strategy was adopted in July 2011, and no comprehensive update has been successful since then. The Borough Council worked for many years on a new Local Plan and submitted a draft plan for examination in August 2023. However, the Planning Inspector examining it found the plan unsound in September 2024, principally because it significantly undershot the required housing need and proposed no Green Belt release. The Inspector indicated the plan could only be made sound with major modifications (increasing housing provision). Faced with this, Elmbridge requested an extension of time to rework the plan, which the government refused. Consequently, in February 2025 the council withdrew the draft plan to start over. As of 2025, Elmbridge has returned to the drawing board, and adoption of a new plan is unlikely before 2028. In the interim, the 2011 Core Strategy (and a 2015 Development Management plan) are the only adopted policies, all of which predate the current NPPF. This means virtually all development applications will be considered under the tilted balance – Elmbridge cannot demonstrate a five-year housing supply or an up-to-date plan. The borough is already experiencing speculative applications on Green Belt and other sensitive sites, which the Council may struggle to refuse on policy grounds. Until a new plan is adopted, Elmbridge’s planning control is limited. The risk of unplanned developments being allowed on appeal is extremely high given the policy vacuum. The situation underscores an acute need for a new sound local plan, as well as potential intervention (the area’s unmet housing need is also part of wider sub-regional discussions). Overall, Elmbridge’s plan status represents one of the highest-risk scenarios in the country at present.",

A review was initiated by Eden District Council’s executive in 2019 to assess necessary updates, but progress was overtaken by local government reorganisation. In April 2023, Eden District was merged into the new Westmorland and Furness unitary authority. The new council will need to produce a unified local plan for its area, incorporating Eden, but this process is in its early stages. As a result, Eden’s 2018 Local Plan remains the operative plan for its area, and its policies (while relatively recent) are technically out-of-date under the NPPF’s 5-year rule. The degree of risk is moderate: Eden has generally met its modest housing targets, but moving forward, the standard method will dictate housing need until a new plan is in place. The rural nature of the district and the fact that the plan runs to 2032 mean the existing allocations still guide current development, reducing immediate pressure. However, without a timely update, Eden (now Westmorland and Furness for planning purposes) could see developers arguing the tilted balance for additional sites. The transition to the new unitary plan adds uncertainty in timing. In summary, Eden’s plan is out-of-date and awaiting a comprehensive review under the new authority, creating a pause in up-to-date plan-making and some vulnerability until an updated plan is adopted.",

However, the plan did have a notable housing shortfall (around 2,600 homes not allocated) even at adoption, which the council acknowledges will need to be addressed. Eastleigh has already begun initial work on a potential Local Plan review to extend the plan period and meet longer-term needs, though this is at a very early stage. In summary, Eastleigh’s planning status is secure in the short term due to its newly adopted plan. Any development risks are low, primarily centering on the need to plan for growth beyond 2036.

A draft emerging plan was under consultation (initial Reg.18 stages were around 2019), but as of 2025 this new plan has not yet been submitted for examination. Thus, the borough is still relying on policies that predate the NPPF 2019/2021 revisions. This leaves Eastbourne in a vulnerable position regarding housing delivery: the adopted plan’s housing targets and allocations are dated, and under the NPPF the plan’s policies are considered out-of-date (triggering the tilted balance) due to age. The council will likely need to accelerate the new Local Plan 2019–2039 to regain control over development. In the meantime, development proposals may come forward on unallocated sites, citing the lack of an up-to-date plan.

The council conducted a five-year review of the Waveney Plan in March 2024, which initially found the plan remained effective. However, a subsequent change (an updated NPPF with higher standard method housing figures) led East Suffolk to conclude that an update to the Waveney Local Plan is required. The Local Development Scheme (March 2024) sets an indicative timetable to begin this plan update. In practical terms, East Suffolk is in a relatively strong position short-term: both local plans are recently adopted, and the authority can demonstrate housing land supply under those plans. The Suffolk Coastal plan is still within five years of adoption (so its policies carry full weight), whereas the Waveney plan has just passed five years, meaning its housing policies will start to be considered “out-of-date” until updated. The council’s decision to update the Waveney plan (and likely to eventually unify the plans for the whole East Suffolk area) will address this.

Once the new Local Plan 2020–2040 is adopted, it should restore a firm policy basis, but currently the authority is in a transitional phase with an out-of-date plan under active replacement.",

A full draft of the new plan was published and consulted on, with the latest public consultation running through early 2025. This indicates the plan is on track for submission to the Planning Inspectorate in 2025. Until the new plan is examined and adopted, East Devon must rely on its 2016 plan. Because that plan is older than five years, its housing policies carry reduced weight under NPPF rules, engaging the presumption in favor of sustainable development (the “tilted balance”). Speculative housing applications are more likely to succeed if the council cannot demonstrate an up-to-date plan and land supply. The emerging plan, once adopted (expected by 2025–26), will address this by providing an updated strategy through 2040. In the interim, East Devon faces moderate risk from development pressures due to the plan’s age, though the imminent new plan adoption should soon restore policy certainty.",

While this partial update refreshed the housing target policy, the majority of the plan’s policies are now around a decade old. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) advises that plans be reviewed every five years, so by 2025 East Cambridgeshire’s plan is considered out-of-date despite the 2023 amendment. The council has not yet advanced work on a comprehensive new Local Plan. As a result, housing proposals may engage the NPPF’s “tilted balance” due to the age of the plan. However, the recent single-issue review likely helps sustain the housing land supply in the short term.

In practice, Tunbridge Wells has maintained decent housing delivery even under the aging plan – the 2023 Housing Delivery Test was 94%, just shy of the 95% benchmark and comfortably above the presumption threshold.

The Council has since started over. A new Local Plan covering 2021–2041 was finally submitted in December 2024, aiming to break the cycle of failed plans. During this prolonged planning vacuum, Uttlesford’s development has been essentially governed by the NPPF.

The West Berkshire Local Plan Review 2023–2040 was examined in 2024 and the Inspector’s report (April 2025) found it sound, paving the way for formal adoption by mid-2025. This new plan will promptly replace the older documents and provide up-to-date allocations (including additional housing at Newbury and Thatcham) and policies aligned with the latest NPPF. Despite the aging core strategy, West Berkshire consistently maintained a strong housing supply and delivery – the 2023 HDT result was 146% – meaning the tilted balance was avoided. With the reviewed plan essentially adopted, West Berkshire’s risk is low: the transition to the new plan ensures continuity of policy strength without needing NPPF default mechanisms.",

Having passed its five-year anniversary in 2024, the JLP underwent a mandatory five-year review: the authorities concluded the plan was performing well, though an update will likely commence to extend the plan period. West Devon’s portion of the plan has seen strong housing delivery (the combined area achieved about 161% of required housing in 2023) and maintains a comfortable land supply, aided by allocations in towns like Okehampton and Tavistock. Because the plan is only slightly beyond 5 years and a review is anticipated, and given solid delivery, West Devon’s plan risk is moderate.

The Council has since regrouped and is now preparing a more modest Local Plan 2023–2040, with public consultations held in 2023. In practice, West Lancashire has maintained strong development rates under the old plan – notably, housing completions have far outstripped targets (the borough delivered 264% of its requirement in 2023), aided by large sites at Skelmersdale and Burscough. Thus, the out-of-date plan has not led to undersupply; on the contrary, the council has a buffer. The risk is moderate mainly because an updated policy framework is needed to manage growth beyond 2027. If the new plan progresses smoothly to adoption, West Lancashire will return to a low-risk footing. For now, policies older than 5 years require careful interpretation alongside NPPF, but the land supply position prevents forced “tilted balance” approvals.",

With PfE now part of the development plan, Wigan’s land supply and strategic policies are up-to-date even though the detailed development management policies from 2013 will eventually need refreshing. Wigan has generally met its housing targets (hovering around the 95–100% mark on the Housing Delivery Test) through a mix of brownfield redevelopment and suburban sites, so it has not been subject to the presumption in recent years.

However, without the new plan, the council’s ability to demonstrate a rolling five-year supply was coming under pressure, and some developers have cited out-of-date policies at appeal.

In the years prior, the absence of a modern plan had placed Wirral in a precarious position: the Council was threatened with government intervention for failing to progress a plan, and developers frequently cited the lack of a five-year supply to justify proposals. Housing delivery was below targets (around 42% in the 2023 HDT) and the tilted balance was often applied at appeals. With the adoption of the Local Plan, Wirral now has a firm framework and a pipeline of sites to boost delivery. The plan risk is now low.

    "notes": "Woking’s Core Strategy was one of the early post-NPPF plans, adopted in October 2012. By itself it would be out-of-date now, but Woking bolstered its planning framework with a Site Allocations DPD, adopted in October 2021, which identified additional development sites (including some Green Belt releases) to meet needs up to 2027. This partial update means Woking’s land supply has been refreshed and a five-year supply can be demonstrated. The borough’s housing delivery has been close to requirements – the 2023 Housing Delivery Test was about 92%, just under the 100% mark but above the threshold for any sanction. Woking’s situation is complicated by severe financial difficulties declared in 2023, which could slow infrastructure investment, but the planning framework itself is intact. While a full local plan review is due (the council will need to plan for post-2027 growth and respond to any unmet need from neighbors), for now the existing Core Strategy + 2021 DPD combination is managing development. Plan risk is scored as mild. Most policies are being applied without NPPF override, but an update will be needed in the coming years. Close monitoring is warranted given Woking’s constraints, yet current risk is contained.",

    "notes": "Wokingham Borough’s existing planning framework consists of a 2010 Core Strategy and a 2014 Managing Development Delivery (MDD) document. These facilitated several large strategic developments (e.g., Arborfield Green, Shinfield) which largely kept housing delivery on track through the 2010s. However, those plans are now over a decade old, and the borough has struggled to bring forward a new plan amid local controversy over housing numbers. After multiple consultations and pauses, the Wokingham Local Plan Update (covering 2023–2038) was submitted for examination in February 2025. This new plan proposes additional strategic growth, including a garden village at Grazeley (subject to infrastructure and on the edge of Reading) and other extensions, to meet higher future housing needs. In the gap without an updated plan, Wokingham faced mounting speculative pressure – several appeals have been allowed where the council’s five-year supply calculations were disputed, although the borough has continued to meet the Housing Delivery Test (around 105% on average). The current risk is on the higher side of moderate: the old plan’s policies are dated and not fully aligned with the latest NPPF, meaning developers have been pushing beyond allocated sites. The situation should improve significantly once the new plan is adopted, but until then the council must carefully manage development to avoid uncontrolled sprawl. We assign a plan risk score of 8, acknowledging the present vulnerability prior to new plan adoption.",

This new Wolverhampton Local Plan was submitted for examination in March 2025. It sets out new housing allocations (mostly on reclaimed industrial land and some Green Belt release at the urban fringe) and modern policies for the city’s regeneration. Until this plan is adopted, Wolverhampton’s planning decisions rely on the old 2011 strategy and the NPPF. The city has performed acceptably on housing delivery (meeting roughly 100% of its target in recent years, aided by initiatives to bring brownfield sites forward), but without an updated plan, Wolverhampton has limited ability to zone new employment land or adapt to retail sector changes, and it faces competition for inward investment from better-planned areas. The plan risk is high at present due to the outdated core strategy, but this should drop once the new local plan is adopted and in force.",

That review was submitted for examination in September 2023. However, as of 2025 the examination has seen some pauses, as the councils considered implications of potential national planning reforms (they briefly delayed hearing sessions pending clarity on housing targets). The adopted 2016 plan is nearing 10 years old, and while many of its policies still function, certain key sites (like the Worcester urban extensions) have progressed slower than anticipated, affecting five-year land supply margins. Worcester City itself has consistently met its housing requirement (often via city regeneration schemes, with 180% delivery in 2020 dropping to around 100% by 2023). The joint plan review, once adopted (expected in 2025), will introduce new sites (including a proposed new town at Throckmorton). In the interim, the plan risk for Worcester is moderate. The majority of development management decisions can still rely on SWDP 2016 policies without invoking the NPPF presumption, but the buffer is thinning. A timely completion of the SWDP Review will be critical to maintain control. Given the advanced stage of the review, Worcester’s risk is contained at level 6.",

Delivery is proceeding per the plan (HDT naturally shows ~55% but that reflects the accepted constraint). No NPPF presumption issues – very low risk.",
    "notes": "The Borough of Worthing faced a significant challenge: very high housing need versus a small, constrained urban area (hemmed by the sea and the South Downs National Park). Worthing’s new Local Plan 2020–2036, adopted in March 2023, strikes a balance by allocating all feasible sites (including increased densities in the town centre and releasing a small amount of peripheral greenfield land) to deliver around 3,700 homes, which is below the calculated “standard method” need but was justified by exceptional constraints. The Planning Inspector accepted this approach, and the plan is now up-to-date. Because the plan’s housing requirement is lower than the government’s need figure, Worthing’s Housing Delivery Test percentages appear low (e.g., 66% in 2023). However, this does not trigger the presumption since the council is delivering against the plan’s realistic targets and has an agreed stepped trajectory. Indeed, without an updated plan, Worthing previously had no choice but to under-deliver; now, with the new plan, it has a confirmed supply pipeline. The council can demonstrate a five-year supply per the adopted plan. Therefore, despite the unique circumstances, Worthing’s plan risk is very low. The plan will be monitored, but as long as it delivers what it set out (which it is on track to do), the NPPF presumption will not apply adversely.",

    "notes": "Wychavon’s planning context is tied to the South Worcestershire Development Plan (SWDP) jointly adopted in 2016. The SWDP covers Wychavon, Worcester, and Malvern Hills, and allocated substantial growth in Wychavon (notably a major urban extension at Worcester South and the new town at Worcestershire Parkway). Because of these allocations, Wychavon has seen very strong housing delivery – consistently exceeding its annual requirements (the 2023 HDT for Wychavon was roughly 180%). The council has been able to demonstrate more than a five-year supply. The SWDP Review, once adopted (expected in 2025), will roll the plan forward to 2041 and include new allocations (Wychavon is slated for another new settlement at Throckmorton Airfield). While the 2016 plan is technically out-of-date by time, its robust allocations and Wychavon’s positive delivery mean that, functionally, NPPF default mechanisms have not been triggered. The authority continues to approve development in line with the plan (with the exception of some localized phosphate constraint issues near the River Avon, which are being mitigated). Plan risk for Wychavon is moderate given the plan’s age, but the active progress on the review and the lack of any tilted-balance appeals (due to good supply) keep the situation stable.

With this review, Wyre’s plan is fully up-to-date.

Early monitoring shows housing delivery ramping up as the strategic sites begin to build out (the Housing Delivery Test is not a concern, as completions are expected to meet or slightly exceed annual requirements going forward).

This marks a turning point – previously, the lack of a plan meant the presumption in favor of development often applied by default, but now York has a full policy framework. Housing delivery in York has been strong in recent years even without a plan (the 2023 HDT was about 120%), and the new plan will support continued delivery with clearer infrastructure commitments. With an up-to-date plan, York can manage development proactively rather than reacting under NPPF defaults. The plan risk is therefore assessed as very low (1).

Until the new plan is adopted (expected by ~2025–26), Gateshead relies on its 2015 policies, which means parts of the NPPF’s default ‘presumption’ apply due to the plan’s age. The emerging plan aims to address updated needs (housing, climate, etc.) well into the 2040s. In the interim, housing applications may be judged against NPPF if the existing policies are deemed out-of-date, although the Council maintains it has a 5-year housing land supply.",

Indeed, Derbyshire Dales has been applying the tilted balance for housing proposals since the plan’s 5-year anniversary. The plan review aims to address this by adopting a new plan (target 2025–26). Until then, the authority is somewhat vulnerable to speculative development, though the Peak District National Park covers a portion of the district (limiting where development pressure is focused).",

    "notes": "High Peak Borough’s Local Plan was adopted on 14 April 2016, setting out development allocations and policies through 2031. This plan coordinated with the Peak District National Park Authority (which covers part of the borough) to direct growth mainly to Buxton, Glossop, and Chapel-en-le-Frith. As of 2025, the plan is nearly a decade old and in need of review. However, to date High Peak BC has not published a new Local Plan timetable, likely due to awaiting national policy changes. The 2016 plan is therefore increasingly misaligned with updated housing need figures (Standard Method indicates a higher annual requirement than the plan planned for). The council has maintained a 5-year housing supply by bringing forward reserve sites, but several appeal decisions have cited the plan’s age to apply NPPF’s presumption. The risk of speculative development is rising, particularly around Glossop (close to Manchester) where demand is strong. High Peak will be required to formally assess the plan by 2026; failing to start a review soon could lead to intervention. Plan risk is high until a review commences.",

Charnwood prepared a comprehensive new Local Plan for 2021–2037, which was submitted for examination in December 2021. However, examination has been protracted – by 2024 inspectors had raised concerns about soundness (notably over Leicester’s unmet need distribution and environmental constraints), and the process was paused pending clarity from national policy changes. Meanwhile, the 2015 Core Strategy is over 5 years old, so its housing policies are considered out-of-date. Charnwood does not have a confirmed 5-year land supply (in 2022 it was ~3.04 years), so the tilted balance is routinely invoked. This has led to approvals of large housing schemes on unallocated sites. The plan vacuum will persist until the new Local Plan is adopted (potentially in 2025 if issues are resolved). Plan risk is high due to the uncertainty and current policy weakness, although the emerging plan is at an advanced stage awaiting modifications.",

The 2019 plan is now 6 years old, so its housing policies are technically out-of-date; however Harborough can demonstrate a healthy land supply (over 7 years) which gives some protection. The council also passed the latest Housing Delivery Test (delivering ~120% of target). Still, because of the plan’s age and the commitment to an update, decisions on new large sites consider the emerging context.

As of 2025, H&B is finalizing this plan for submission before the June 2025 LURB transition deadline. In the absence of an up-to-date plan, development management relies on outdated policies – the borough has struggled with speculative applications, especially for housing in rural villages, as it cannot demonstrate a sufficient land supply. In fact, by late 2022 the Council had to pause some decisions pending interim arrangements. Once the new plan is adopted, it will significantly lower risk by allocating ample housing (including a new settlement at Jennings) and updating Green Belt boundaries.

It will set new housing targets for Gedling (likely increased to address Nottingham’s unmet need) and broad allocations. Once that is adopted, Gedling will update or replace its 2018 Part 2 plan to align with new strategic policies and extend site allocations further. In the interim, Gedling’s 2018 Part 2 provides some up-to-date development management policies, but the housing requirement in the 2014 ACS is superseded by the Standard Method. Gedling has struggled with housing delivery (2022 HDT was 75%, just on the threshold) and has had to use NPPF’s tilted balance on some applications.

The emerging plan includes significant housing allocations (e.g. urban extensions south of Cannock and at Rugeley) and addresses cross-boundary needs (Birmingham’s housing shortfall was considered in earlier drafts). Until the new plan is adopted (likely in 2025/26), the 2014 Core Strategy’s policies over 5 years old and an incomplete allocations portfolio mean the NPPF presumption often applies. Indeed, Cannock has been in the tilted balance for residential schemes for several years due to an insufficient 5-year land supply.

This new draft plan proposes adjusted housing figures (likely reduced from the 2017 plan) and extends policies to 2041. It addresses issues such as delivering the city’s share of the Housing Market Area need while recalibrating for the latest demographic trends. As of early 2025, the plan is not yet adopted, so Coventry is operating with the 2017 plan’s policies. Those are 8 years old, so absent the review, they’d be considered out-of-date – however Coventry took steps to review within 5 years, which may lend some continued weight to the existing policies until the new plan is in place. The city currently has a marginal 5-year land supply and had a Housing Delivery Test result of 82% (2022), meaning a 20% buffer is applied but not the full presumption.

Consequently, Dudley developed a standalone Dudley Local Plan 2023–2041, which it submitted for examination in February 2025. This plan identifies sites to meet Dudley’s needs to 2041, focusing development within the urban area and selective Green Belt releases around Kingswinford and Halesowen. The submitted plan will supersede the 2011 Core Strategy upon adoption (expected in 2025/26). Currently, without a modern adopted plan, Dudley has been handling applications under the tilted balance. Housing supply has been short (the borough had <4 years supply in 2022), and the 2022 Housing Delivery Test was only ~50%, leading to the presumption in favor of sustainable development being engaged. The planning risk in Dudley is therefore high until the new plan is adopted. Notably, some major sites (like the failed joint allocation at Green Belt land) remain contentious.

Following the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, Central Beds in January 2024 decided to prepare a new style Local Plan that integrates new requirements. This effectively launches an update process earlier than required. The current plan remains operative and up-to-date; the council continues to demonstrate a 5-year housing supply (around 5.6 years) and passed the HDT (119% in 2022). Thus, no NPPF default applies.

    "notes": "Cambridge City Council’s current Local Plan was adopted in October 2018. It was prepared in tandem with South Cambridgeshire’s plan, and together they satisfied housing needs to 2031 (including allocating the new town at Waterbeach and fringe sites around Cambridge). Given rapid growth pressures, work on a joint Greater Cambridge Local Plan 2020–2041 began soon after adoption. Issues & Options consultation occurred in 2020, and a Preferred Options draft (with sites for ~44,400 new homes by 2041) was published in late 2021. However, progress slowed due to concerns over water supply (the “water neutrality” issue in the chalk aquifer) and awaiting government changes. As of 2025, the new joint plan is still in draft, likely to be submitted in 2025. Meanwhile, the 2018 Cambridge Plan is over 5 years old, rendering its policies formally out-of-date. The councils have continued to approve significant developments (e.g. NEC and North East Cambridge area) using a proactive approach, but technically the tilted balance could be applied if a proposal conflicts with the aging plan. Both Cambridge and South Cambs have been able to show >5-year land supply and strong delivery (Cambridge delivered 140% of requirement in 2022), which helps. The risk will persist until the Greater Cambridge Plan is adopted (anticipated ~2026), after which Cambridge will again have an up-to-date framework aligned with longer-term growth and infrastructure (like Cambridge South station and water infrastructure).",

    "notes": "Fenland District Council’s current Local Plan was adopted in May 2014 and set a high-level growth strategy to 2031 (with broad locations rather than specific allocations). Over the past decade, delivery in Fenland (Wisbech, March, etc.) has lagged targets, and the plan became increasingly out-of-date. The Council began a New Fenland Local Plan 2021–2040 and reached Regulation 18 Draft consultation in 2022. However, as of Q4 2023 the plan process was reportedly “paused” due to staffing and awaiting clarity on national changes. This means Fenland still operates under the 2014 plan. The NPPF presumption applies strongly: the district has consistently been unable to show a 5-year housing land supply (as of April 2023 it was ~2.8 years) and had a Housing Delivery Test result of 45% in 2022, triggering the most severe sanction. Consequently, developers have had success on appeal for unplanned greenfield sites. The lack of an up-to-date plan also complicates securing infrastructure for the planned urban extensions. The council’s risk is high until the new plan is completed. It is expected they will revive the local plan effort in 2024 with a goal of adoption by 2026 if possible, to guide growth in a more managed way. In the interim, Fenland remains in a de facto planning “vacuum” with decisions largely guided by the NPPF.",

An Issues & Scoping consultation for a new Plan (likely extending to 2040 or beyond) was carried out, and further evidence gathering is underway. As of mid-2025, the 2019 plan is 6 years old, so technically beyond the 5-year mark – however, since a review is actively in train, the council can argue its policies are being kept under scrutiny. The district has maintained above 5-year housing supply (partly due to the Alconbury Weald delivery) and delivered 115% of its housing requirement in 2022, so it hasn’t faced the tilted balance scenario yet. The emerging joint spatial framework for Greater Cambridge and surrounding areas could also influence the new plan. Overall, Huntingdonshire’s current plan is only slightly outdated and is undergoing proactive updating. Risk is comparatively low, mitigated by strong delivery and the active review (though if the new plan were significantly delayed, risk would rise in the late 2020s).",

However, in June 2022, following local elections and intense opposition to Green Belt releases, the Council voted to withdraw the plan. As a result, Castle Point remains without an NPPF-compliant plan. It faces one of the worst planning situations nationally: no 5-year housing supply, one of the oldest plans in England, and high housing pressure. The government has warned Castle Point (through intervention letters) about its lack of plan. The Council has indicated it will restart plan-making under the new rules (likely aiming to use the more flexible housing targets expected in revised NPPF). In the interim, virtually all housing applications are decided under the NPPF presumption. Recent appeal decisions have allowed large developments on Green Belt (which the withdrawn plan had allocated) due to the absence of an up-to-date plan. Plan risk is extremely high – effectively a planning “vacuum” until a new plan is produced (estimated not before 2026).",

Chelmsford accordingly started a Local Plan Review in late 2022. Issues & Options consultation (branded Local Plan Review 2022) occurred and a Preferred Approach is expected in 2024. The adopted 2020 plan remains sound and in effect – at exactly 5 years old in 2025, it’s on the cusp of requiring an update, but the active review satisfies that. Chelmsford maintains a >5-year housing supply and delivered 164% of its housing requirement in 2022, meaning all NPPF tests are passed. The early review will likely boost housing targets slightly (due to higher household forecasts) and roll the plan forward to 2041.

The intention is to produce a single new plan covering Colchester to 2040. The current plan, being only ~3–4 years old, is up-to-date and robust. Colchester has a healthy housing land supply (around 6.5 years) and high delivery rates (144% in 2022 HDT). Therefore, it is not defaulting under NPPF.

Harlow’s planning efforts are currently centered on implementing these allocations (for example, the Newhall and Gilston sites are progressing). A formal review is not yet initiated, but will be due by 2025 per statutory requirement. However, given the cooperation needed with adjacent districts (Epping’s plan is 2018; East Herts 2018), any review might be aligned regionally. Harlow has maintained a >100% Housing Delivery Test and has a 5-year supply, so NPPF para 11 is not triggered. Environmental constraints (Epping Forest SAC air quality) are monitored but under control through agreed mitigation. In summary, Harlow’s plan situation is stable and low-risk.

Concurrently, Dacorum is a participant in the emerging South West Hertfordshire Joint Strategic Plan 2050 – a high-level plan to coordinate growth across Dacorum, Hertsmere, St Albans, Three Rivers, and Watford. That JSP is at early issues stage and likely to inform the next generation of local plans beyond this cycle. In the interim, Dacorum’s planning decisions rely on an out-of-date plan. The borough has been heavily exposed to speculative applications; it has fallen below a 5-year housing land supply (approx. 3.9 years) and Housing Delivery Test was 72% in 2022, resulting in NPPF presumption in favor. Some large greenfield schemes near Hemel have come forward due to this. The submission of the new Local Plan is a critical turning point – if adopted by late 2025, it will restore an up-to-date framework and significantly lower risk.

By the mid-2010s it became clear a new plan was needed to meet growth and address London overspill. The Council produced a Draft Local Plan (Reg 19) in 2021 proposing ~12,000 new homes with substantial Green Belt release, but following a wave of opposition and a change in political control, Hertsmere withdrew that draft in November 2022. This left the borough without any emerging plan and relying on a 12-year-old strategy. In April 2024, Hertsmere’s cabinet formally agreed to begin work on a new Local Plan under updated national policy. A new Issues & Options (Reg 18) consultation is expected in late 2024. In the meantime, Hertsmere has almost no readily developable non-Green Belt land left and cannot demonstrate a 5-year housing supply; its 2022 HDT was just 34%, among the lowest in England. Thus, the presumption in favor of development is fully engaged – but paradoxically, many applications are in Green Belt where NPPF provides additional protection. This has resulted in a development stalemate: little housing delivery (hence the low HDT) yet strong resistance to proposals on Green Belt. The plan vacuum keeps risk extremely high. Only once a new plan is adopted (likely ~2026–27) will Hertsmere regain a coherent strategy. Until then, planning is essentially reactive, with the Council heavily defending appeals and using interim measures. Hertsmere is also contributing to the SW Herts 2050 joint strategy, but that is in early stages and won’t directly allocate housing in the short term.",

Under threat of government intervention, the Council prepared a new Local Plan 2020–2038, which it submitted in November 2024. This new plan proposes around 15,000 homes and some Green Belt releases to meet both local need and some of Luton’s unmet need. Examination hearings are expected in mid-2025. Until adoption, St Albans remains effectively without an operative plan. The NPPF presumption has been the basis for deciding most significant applications, which has led to piecemeal approvals (e.g. several large sites around Harpenden were allowed on appeal). Housing delivery has been inadequate (the 2022 HDT was 34%, same as Hertsmere, triggering the presumption). The lack of a plan has also hampered infrastructure funding and coordinated development (the district has seen under-provision of affordable housing due to reliance on windfalls). Plan risk is extremely high but – assuming the new plan proceeds to adoption by 2025/26 – St Albans may soon emerge from this long period of planning by appeal. The new plan’s success is critical; if it were to fail examination, direct government intervention is likely. For now, the district sits at the extreme end of NPPF defaulting, with minimal local policy weight in decisions.",

As of 2025, the adopted plan is slightly out-of-date in terms of housing need (Standard Method suggests a higher annual figure). Cotswold’s housing delivery has been borderline (2022 HDT ~95%) and its 5-year land supply is marginal. Thus, some weight is given to the NPPF presumption on appeal.

    "notes": "Great Yarmouth Borough’s current development plan consists of the Core Strategy 2013–2030 adopted in December 2015 and a Part 2 Local Plan adopted in 2021 that allocated additional sites. While the Part 2 (2021) extended the supply, the strategic policies are still from 2015, now 10 years old. The Council has prepared a new Great Yarmouth Local Plan 2021–2041, which it submitted for examination in February 2025. This new plan will integrate the Core Strategy and allocations, addressing needs for an extended period (including regeneration of the waterfront and coastal flood adaptation). Until the new plan is adopted (likely 2026), the borough relies on the mix of 2015 and 2021 plans. Some policies – especially on housing numbers – are considered out-of-date under NPPF because the Core Strategy housing requirement was based on revoked regional targets. However, Great Yarmouth has unique constraints (significant flood-risk areas and economic challenges) that have led to lower delivery historically (the 2022 HDT was ~67%, invoking presumption). The submitted plan proposes ambitious housing growth with mitigation for flood zones. The current risk remains moderate-high: although the Part 2 plan (2021) means many allocations are recent, the overarching strategy is outdated, and the area does not have a full 5-year supply. The situation is set to improve once the new plan is in place with up-to-date policies and allocations through 2041.",

It also incorporates updated policies on design, climate change, and town centres. With this adoption, all policies are up-to-date and the borough can demonstrate a healthy 5-year land supply (the plan allocates more than required to ensure flexibility). Prior to adoption, KLWN faced some pressure as the old plan’s end date 2026 loomed, but now that risk has been alleviated. The council will need to consider another review by 2030. For now, the planning framework is sound and NPPF default provisions do not apply.

    "notes": "The City of London Corporation’s existing Local Plan was adopted in January 2015. It primarily focused on sustaining the Square Mile as a financial district, with modest housing targets and strict protections for office space. Recognizing changing dynamics (e.g. prior to COVID, then accelerated by it), the Corporation has drafted a new City Plan 2040. This plan was submitted in August 2024 for examination after extensive consultation. The City Plan 2040 introduces more flexible policies for mixed-use developments, encourages sustainable tall buildings and a greening of the City’s public realm, and plans for a post-pandemic balance of office and other uses. Because the 2015 plan is now 10 years old and the new plan is not yet adopted, there have been instances where the City Corporation had to rely on the NPPF (for example, to consider office-to-residential changes or updated development management standards). However, the City has unique circumstances: it consistently over-delivers on office space and has minimal housing obligations (which are easily met on small windfall sites). The lack of a 5-year housing land supply isn’t a concern given the City’s housing target is low (the City delivered ~130 units in 2022, above target). Thus, the main risk from the outdated plan is policy rigidity rather than housing shortfall. The timely adoption of City Plan 2040 (expected in 2025) will restore a fully up-to-date policy set. Risk is moderate and chiefly related to ensuring the City can adapt to modern needs (e.g. integrating urban greening) in the meantime.",

A Regulation 18 Draft Local Plan was published in early 2021, proposing increased housing (around 4,275 homes by 2040) and new regeneration sites (like expanding the allocation at Bohemia). However, further progress has been slow; as of 2025 the plan has not reached submission. Consequently, Hastings’ 2014/15 plans are now considered out-of-date. The borough consistently undershot housing delivery (2022 HDT was 48%) and cannot demonstrate a 5-year housing supply. This means the tilted balance applies and indeed Hastings has seen several appeal decisions go against it (particularly on the urban fringe where unmet need is cited). Constraints such as limited urban land and environmental designations add complexity. The emerging plan will likely be submitted in 2025, aiming for adoption in 2026 to reset the strategy with realistic yet higher housing targets and strong regeneration focus. Until then, plan risk is high – effectively the NPPF governs development, and the council is vulnerable to developer-led schemes beyond its outdated allocations.",

The borough committed to an update before 5 years had elapsed. Indeed, a Local Plan Update process began, but progress was delayed by uncertainty over government housing targets. By October 2023, Basingstoke launched a Regulation 18 consultation on options for the new Local Plan 2024–2040. The new plan will address a higher housing need (~17,820 homes) and possibly a new settlement. Meanwhile, the adopted plan—though nearing its end date—still carries weight, but with caution: being 9 years old, the housing policies are subject to NPPF paragraph 11. Basingstoke has a mixed record on delivery: it had a 4.3-year land supply in 2022, so the presumption has been triggered. The council has faced speculative proposals, notably for sites not in the 2016 plan. The emerging plan aims to rectify the supply gap and modernize policies (on environment, infrastructure etc.). Until that is adopted (target 2025), the authority balances using its 2016 policies with acknowledging they’re aging. Risk is moderate-high in the short term, largely due to land supply shortfall, but will reduce once the new plan provides fresh allocations (including likely reserve sites held in the interim).",

It replaced the former 2015 Local Plan. With this recent adoption, Fareham’s policies are all NPPF-compliant and carry full weight. The council has a robust 5-year housing land supply primarily due to Welborne’s anticipated delivery trajectory and steady smaller site supply. Fareham slightly failed the 2022 Housing Delivery Test (at 73%), but because it now has an adopted up-to-date plan with strong supply measures, it is not in a presumption scenario moving forward.

    "notes": "Gosport Borough Council’s current Local Plan was adopted in October 2015, covering development needs to 2029. As a small urban authority with constrained land (no Green Belt, but limited open sites and significant MoD land), Gosport has struggled to meet housing targets, relying on redevelopment of brownfield sites. The 2015 plan is now beyond 5 years; the Council published a Regulation 18 draft Gosport Borough Local Plan 2038 in 2022 proposing modest additional allocations (e.g. Royal Haslar Hospital site) and an uplifted housing target (~5,500 homes by 2038 vs ~3,060 in old plan). However, further progress has been slow likely due to nutrient neutrality issues affecting the Solent. By 2025, the new plan is not yet at Reg 19. Thus, Gosport’s 2015 plan is considered out-of-date and it cannot demonstrate a 5-year housing supply (recently around 4 years). The NPPF presumption is in effect, but the borough’s lack of available land means few speculative applications come forward (most of Gosport is built-up or constrained by Portsmouth Harbour SPA). The risk lies in under-delivery – Gosport’s 2022 HDT was 47%, triggering presumption. The council continues working on mitigation (nutrient credits, etc.) to unlock housing sites. The forthcoming plan (expected submission in 2024) should help by allocating every feasible site and aligning with sub-regional strategies. Until adoption (likely 2025/26), Gosport’s plan risk is high on paper, but in practice development is slow regardless due to physical constraints. Still, having an updated plan is critical to demonstrate how needs will be met (potentially through partnership with neighbouring areas for any unmet requirement).",

It allocates sufficient land for 7,614 new homes, including a new community at Shapley Heath (Murrell Green/Winchfield area) that was intended to be a significant part of the supply. Since adoption, a change in local politics led to Shapley Heath being scaled back (studies halted in 2021), but the plan’s other allocations and a strong pipeline (e.g. Hartland Village redevelopment) keep Hart above its required housing supply. At 5 years old, the plan is just at the threshold of requiring a review; the Council will undertake a formal five-year review in 2025 to decide if an update is needed. So far, Hart has exceeded its housing targets annually (2022 HDT ~150%) and can demonstrate about 8 years of housing land supply. Therefore, the NPPF tilted balance does not apply. No emerging new plan is underway yet. The risk in Hart is low, although there is a known long-term issue of how to accommodate growth beyond 2032 without Shapley Heath – something a future plan update (perhaps late 2020s) will have to address jointly with neighbours if necessary. For now, the adopted plan is performing well and provides certainty for development management.",

Havant developed a new Local Plan 2036 and submitted it in 2021, but examination was put on hold due to the Solent nutrient neutrality problem (impacting new housing near sensitive harbors). In Feb 2022 the council withdrew that submission and immediately recommenced work on an updated plan with strengthened environmental measures, now called the “Building a Better Future” Local Plan. By 2023, Havant secured mitigation strategies (a strategic nitrate reduction scheme) and was preparing to re-submit the plan likely in 2024. This stop-start process has left Havant without an up-to-date plan for over a decade. The borough lacks a 5-year housing supply, and its 2022 HDT was 67%, so the NPPF presumption is engaged. However, development in Havant is also constrained by the nutrient issue – until mitigations were in place, the council had imposed a de facto moratorium on new housing permissions. As that is resolving, the new plan will allocate necessary sites (including greenfield urban extensions at Havant and Waterlooville) to meet the Standard Method need (~504 dpa). In the interim, decisions rely on national policy and the aging local policies (which carry limited weight now). Plan risk remains high until the “Better Future” plan is adopted, anticipated in 2025. Thereafter, with an updated plan and nutrient mitigations, Havant’s situation should stabilize. This case underscores how external environmental regulations delayed plan-making, exacerbating the policy vacuum.",

    "notes": "Canterbury City’s Local Plan was adopted in July 2017 and planned growth to 2031, including urban extensions at Canterbury, Herne Bay and Sturry. By 2020, work began on a new plan to extend the horizon. A Regulation 18 draft Canterbury District Local Plan 2045 was published in Oct 2022, courting controversy with proposals for a new ring-road and large Greenfield allocations (notably 9,000 homes in a new Canterbury “Garden Community” with a bypass) to accommodate ~16,000 homes. This sparked political change in 2023, but the new administration is continuing the plan process with some revisions. The new plan is due to be submitted in 2024. Meanwhile, the 2017 plan, being over 5 years old, is formally out-of-date. Canterbury has still been delivering strongly (2022 HDT 132%) thanks to sites from that plan coming on stream (e.g. Broad Oak, South Canterbury). However, Canterbury cannot demonstrate a full 5-year supply if using the higher Standard Method targets (which the emerging plan adopts). This means some speculative applications are difficult to resist; indeed, appeals have cited the plan’s age to push unplanned sites at Whitstable (though the Council has generally maintained control by pointing to the imminent new plan). The risk profile is moderate now but will escalate if the new plan is significantly delayed or altered to reduce housing (as that could invite SoS intervention or more appeals). Assuming Canterbury’s new plan proceeds and is adopted by 2025, the district will transition to an up-to-date framework, albeit one that is controversial locally. In summary, current plan risk is managed by active plan-making, but the pressure to get the new strategy in place is high.",

It sets a housing target of ~790 homes/year and includes large sites like the Dartford Northern Gateway and Ebbsfleet Central. With the plan now adopted, Dartford’s policies are up-to-date and the borough has a comfortable 5-year housing land supply. The adoption also means that Ebbsfleet Development Corporation (which covers part of Dartford) will use this plan as the basis for decisions. There is no need for a new local plan until at least 2029. The risk is extremely low: Dartford has one of the highest housing delivery rates in England (HDT ~240%) due to numerous apartment schemes and major development at Ebbsfleet. The new plan supports continued high delivery while introducing stronger design and environmental policies. NPPF default does not apply in Dartford’s case anymore, and the plan was found sound under the 2021 NPPF, ensuring resilience against upcoming national changes. Focus will be on implementation and working with Ebbsfleet DC. In sum, Dartford’s planning framework is very robust post-2024 plan adoption.",

    "notes": "Dover District Council’s new Local Plan 2040 was adopted in October 2024. This comprehensive plan supersedes the older plan documents (Core Strategy 2010 and Allocations 2015). It allocates about 17,000 homes for 2020–2040, focused around Dover town, Whitfield (expanding the existing new community), and strategic allocations at Deal and Aylesham. The plan also deals with coastal change management and infrastructure (e.g. improvements to the A2 to support port traffic). With adoption, Dover’s policies are fully up-to-date and the council can firmly demonstrate a 5-year supply. Historically, Dover had a slight housing delivery shortfall (2022 HDT ~72%, requiring an action plan), but the new plan significantly boosts supply and should improve delivery rates. The council will not need to consider a new plan until the 2030s. Given the plan’s recency, NPPF default provisions do not apply (and indeed the plan was examined under the latest NPPF rules in 2023). Developers now have certainty on where development is acceptable (whereas previously the aging plan led to speculative proposals along the A256 corridor). Plan risk is minimal moving forward; Dover’s focus is on delivery and securing funding for required road upgrades to unlock the larger allocations. In summary, Dover has a low-risk, up-to-date plan environment as of late 2024.",

It complements the Places and Policies Local Plan adopted in September 2020, which contains detailed site allocations and development management policies for towns and villages. Together, these documents mean the district has a comprehensive up-to-date Local Plan suite. The council can demonstrate a healthy land supply largely thanks to Otterpool Park’s phased delivery (outline permission was granted in 2023). Housing Delivery Test is not an issue (HDT 2022 was 128%). The planning focus is now implementation: Otterpool’s first phases, Folkestone seafront regeneration, and other strategic sites (e.g. at Hythe). With the plan only 1–3 years old, no review is planned until at least 2027. Accordingly, Folkestone & Hythe is not subject to NPPF default rules at present. Plan risk is very low—the district’s growth strategy is settled and has government backing (Otterpool is a Garden Town initiative). Only a substantial failure to progress Otterpool or a radical national policy shift would prompt an earlier plan revisit.",

    "notes": "Gravesham Borough’s Core Strategy 2011–2028 was adopted in September 2014. It made provision for ~6,170 homes mainly through regenerating brownfield sites in Gravesend/Northfleet and a strategic allocation at Ebbsfleet (partly overlapping with EDC area). By 2019, it was evident more housing would be needed (Standard Method increased the annual requirement, plus the borough agreed to take some unmet need from the London Plan). The Council embarked on a Partial Review to identify additional sites. A Regulation 18 consultation on growth options and potential Green Belt releases took place in 2020–2021, indicating the need for around 2,000 extra homes and suggesting possible Green Belt allocations around Meopham and Higham. Since then, the process has been slow, partly due to local opposition to Green Belt loss. As of 2025, Gravesham has not submitted a new plan; a pre-submission (Reg 19) draft is anticipated in late 2024. Meanwhile, the 2014 Core Strategy is beyond 5 years and its housing supply (front-loaded brownfield sites) is nearly exhausted. Gravesham cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply (it’s about 3 years), and its 2022 HDT was 50%, triggering NPPF presumption. Several speculative applications for Green Belt sites have come forward as a result. The council has been resisting these pending the plan review, but appeals pose a risk. The situation will persist until the new allocations plan is adopted (likely 2025/26). Plan risk is high in the short term: the policy vacuum after 2028 combined with unmet need puts pressure on unplanned sites. Once the new plan with allocated Green Belt releases is in place, that risk should recede at the cost of sacrificing protected land to meet housing needs.",

    "notes": "Cherwell District’s Local Plan Part 1 2011–2031 was adopted in July 2015, allocating major sites like NW Bicester Eco-town, Banbury and Bicester urban extensions. In September 2020, the Council adopted a Partial Review (Plan Part 1b) specifically to meet Oxford’s unmet housing need, allocating an additional 4,400 homes in the Kidlington area (north of Oxford). That Partial Review is very recent and those strategic sites are now in early stages of planning. However, aside from that, the main plan remains the 2015 content, which is older. Thus, Cherwell is preparing a new Local Plan 2040 to cover the entire district. A draft Publication Plan was endorsed in Dec 2024, aiming to submit by spring 2025. This plan will extend the strategy to 2040, with further growth in Banbury/Bicester and potentially a new settlement at Arncott. Until the new plan is adopted (likely 2026), Cherwell’s plan is a mix of up-to-date (the 2020 Oxford allocations) and out-of-date (some 2015 era policies). The district has struggled with the 5-year supply recently (4.7 years in 2022), partly due to slower delivery at some strategic sites, which has triggered NPPF presumption for certain proposals. The emerging Plan 2040 addresses this by allocating more deliverable mid-term sites. Meanwhile, Cherwell continues to meet its housing delivery (109% in 2022) and passed the Housing Delivery Test. Plan risk in Cherwell is moderate: while parts of the plan are old, the Partial Review 2020 has injected some fresh supply and the district works closely with Oxon partners. With a new plan in the pipeline, the risk of policy vacuum is being mitigated. Challenges remain if any significant delay occurs, given pressure around Oxford and Bicester for development. The current trajectory though points to a timely update and a managed transition.",

Thus, some policies (like the housing requirement) may be deemed out-of-date post-2024.",
    "notes": "Guildford Borough’s Local Plan is split: the Strategy and Sites Plan adopted in April 2019, and the Development Management Policies Plan adopted in July 2021. The 2019 Strategy removed some land from Green Belt and allocated urban extensions (e.g. Blackwell Farm, Gosden Hill) and a new settlement at Wisley Airfield to meet a housing target of 562 dpa (including 4,000 homes for Woking’s unmet need). That plan was controversial but is now well into implementation (planning apps are in for several strategic sites). By April 2024, five years have passed since adoption, triggering the need for a review per NPPF. However, Guildford’s leadership changed in 2023 and is hesitant to plan for further growth beyond 2034 given local opposition and pending reforms. No formal new Local Plan project has been launched yet. The borough technically cannot demonstrate a full 5-year supply if counting Woking’s unmet need (the inspector anticipated early review if Woking couldn’t deliver its portion). Also, Woking’s plan failure (2023) casts uncertainty on Guildford’s commitment. Meanwhile, Guildford’s delivery is strong (HDT 181%) and it has plenty of permitted supply in pipeline. The plan’s policies remain effective, but as the 5-year mark passes without a review underway, developers may begin arguing the housing requirement should default to Standard Method (which is lower for Guildford, ironically ~470 dpa). The risk of tilted balance is low in practice because Guildford can show a 5-year supply under the lower local need. But procedurally, the plan is “aging out.” The Council likely will hold off major review until Woking’s situation and national policy clarify around 2025. So, while currently Guildford’s plan status is technically out-of-date (no review), in reality the plan’s allocations cover the rest of its period. Plan risk is moderate, mostly around legal challenges on unmet need, but day-to-day the plan is guiding development well. A focused review might occur around 2025 to address post-2034 needs if required.",

    "notes": "Chichester District’s planning situation is complex due to the South Downs National Park covering the northern half (which has its own plan). For the southern “Chichester Plan Area”, the Local Plan: Key Policies 2014–2029 was adopted in July 2015. It became out-of-date in 2020. The Council prepared a Local Plan Review aiming for adoption by 2020, but encountered delays primarily from the need to mitigate nitrate pollution affecting Chichester and Langstone Harbours (similar to Havant’s issue) and highways constraints on the A27 at Chichester. A Submission draft was actually agreed and submitted in May 2022, but the examination could not progress as Natural England maintained an objection on nutrient grounds and infrastructure agreements were incomplete. Chichester ultimately withdrew the plan in May 2023 to avoid it being found unsound. They are now updating evidence and intend to publish a revised Regulation 19 draft by May 2024. This new draft may reduce housing numbers slightly (previously ~12,350 homes to 2037) and adjust allocations (possibly scaling back development in areas affected by nutrient neutrality until a solution is at hand). In the interim, Chichester’s housing supply has fallen under 5 years and the 2022 HDT was 34%, so the tilted balance applies strongly. However, because of the environmental constraints, the council has had a moratorium on many housing permissions, so not much development can exploit the presumption. The planning vacuum is problematic: no up-to-date plan means speculative proposals, but many are blocked by nutrient concerns, creating a stalemate. Plan risk is high; central government has closely watched Chichester’s plan progress. If the new plan is further delayed, intervention is possible. Adoption by 2025/26 is critical to allocate deliverable sites with nutrient mitigation in place. Until then, Chichester remains in limbo with severely constrained housing delivery. The hope is that a resolution on nutrient mitigation (potentially via regional water treatment upgrades or nutrient credit schemes) will align with the new plan adoption, unlocking development and alleviating the current risk.",

It is up-to-date and in line with the latest NPPF.",
    "notes": "Crawley Borough Council adopted the Crawley 2037 Local Plan in October 2024. This plan update was delayed due to the pandemic and uncertainties, but now supersedes the Crawley 2015 Local Plan. Crawley’s situation is unique: it has one of the highest housing needs relative to its area, but is constrained by tight boundaries and the Gatwick Airport noise zone, meaning it cannot meet all its need within. The 2037 Plan provides capacity for ~5,355 homes (375 dpa) largely via town centre regeneration and urban sites (e.g. Telford Place), against a need of ~752 dpa – the shortfall continues to be exported under cooperation to Horsham and Mid Sussex (a long-standing arrangement). The new plan was found sound with that unmet need approach and includes policies to maximize affordable housing and employment growth (Manor Royal is protected for business). Being brand new, the plan’s policies carry full weight and Crawley can maintain a 5-year supply on its reduced local target (it also benefits from the NPPF footnote that caps its requirement due to constraints). The council will likely not review the plan until around 2029 unless circumstances drastically change (e.g. if Gatwick’s expansion triggers a need to update policies). Plan risk is very low for Crawley now: although housing delivery will always be behind the raw need, the agreed redistribution through the West Sussex/Northern West Sussex housing market area means no presumption is triggered. The main challenge will be ensuring neighbouring plans (Horsham’s, Mid Sussex’s) also progress to continue accommodating Crawley’s unmet need – but Crawley’s own plan is sound and up-to-date.",

The delay keeps Horsham without an updated plan – which is problematic given it also takes on unmet need from Crawley. The council still has a solid housing supply pipeline from the 2015 plan (e.g. North of Horsham development), but as time goes on, the lack of a new plan could undermine its supply and trigger more appeals.",
    "notes": "Horsham District’s Planning Framework (HDPF) was adopted in November 2015, setting out development to 2031 including major allocations like 2,500 homes north of Horsham (now under construction). Horsham also agreed to take 150 dpa of Crawley’s unmet need in that plan. A Local Plan Review to 2038/39 began in 2018 with high growth proposals (including several new settlement options). A Regulation 19 draft was prepared in 2020 proposing ~1,200 dpa (including a 3,500-home new garden village at Buck Barn), but its final approval was postponed pending updated government policy. After May 2023 local elections, a new administration in Horsham indicated it might drop or change the new settlement plans. As of 2025, the plan is still not submitted and is being reworked – likely with a new Reg 19 in 2024 that could redistribute growth. Because of this, the 2015 HDPF remains the operative plan and is past its 5-year mark. Horsham has continued to build robustly (2022 HDT 173%) thanks to large sites in the pipeline, and currently can show about 6 years of supply. However, without a new plan, by late 2020s that supply will diminish. Already, speculative proposals (e.g. for more expansion at Southwater) have come forward arguing the plan is aging. The council has managed to fend these off so far by pointing to advanced plan progress and current supply, but further delay heightens risk. If the new plan isn’t submitted by mid-2025, the South East regional examiner could intervene, as Horsham is one of the few districts in Sussex without a plan at least submitted. Once Horsham does adopt a new plan (expected around 2025/26 if political consensus is reached), it will meet a higher share of its own need plus maintain support for Crawley’s unmet needs – critical for the Gatwick Diamond area. In sum, plan risk is moderate now (buffered by ongoing large site build-out) but will increase steadily until the new plan is in place.",

At 9 years old, the plan’s housing targets are based on revoked regional strategies and due for replacement. However, housing delivery in Cornwall has exceeded targets (HDT ~144%), and large planning permissions (especially around eco-communities like West Carclaze) are in place, somewhat buffering the risk from the dated plan in the short term.",
    "notes": "Cornwall Council’s Local Plan: Strategic Policies was adopted in November 2016, shortly after Cornwall became a unitary. It set a countywide housing target of 52,500 homes 2010-2030, distributed to town network areas, with an emphasis on eco-communities (e.g. West Carclaze near St Austell) and urban extensions to towns like Truro and Bodmin. Detailed site allocations for key towns were covered by a separate Site Allocations DPD adopted in 2019. Since then, Cornwall has pivoted to climate emergency and “devolution deal” priorities. The Local Plan is now aging – by 2025 it’s 9 years since adoption. The Council has expressed ambition for a new planning strategy to 2050 (aligned with carbon neutral goals and possibly reducing housing growth to more locally acceptable levels), but formal review has been slow to start, likely awaiting clarity on national planning reforms. In practice, Cornwall’s expansive geography and numerous extant planning consents (with around 30k permissions in the pipeline) mean it continues to have above 5-year supply and strong delivery (HDT 2022 was 144%). Thus, although the plan is technically out-of-date after 5 years, the council has generally not faced the tilted balance except in some appeal cases where specific policies (like those on infill development) were considered inconsistent with NPPF. The risk of speculative development is moderated by the fact that most towns already have allocated urban extensions and the Council can cite its large existing supply. Nonetheless, some policy areas – e.g. affordable housing thresholds, climate policies – would benefit from an update. The Council is likely to commence a full Local Plan update in 2024 with a view to adoption around 2026/27. For now, plan risk is moderate: not immediately dire due to good supply metrics, but the lack of up-to-date strategic vision could become an issue if delivery stalls or if the unitary pursues major policy shifts (like restricting second homes) that require new plan policies. Cornwall also must coordinate with the emerging Devon & Cornwall connectivity strategy (e.g. spaceport, offshore wind), which a new plan will eventually need to incorporate.",

    "notes": "Cheltenham’s planning policy is inextricably linked with Gloucester and Tewkesbury through the Joint Core Strategy (JCS) adopted in December 2017. The JCS provides strategic allocations, including the large urban extensions at North West Cheltenham (~4,285 homes) and West Cheltenham (Cyber Park, ~1,100 homes). Cheltenham then adopted its own Cheltenham Plan in July 2020 to allocate smaller sites and update development management policies. This means Cheltenham has a full plan suite – albeit composed of two parts. The JCS is now 8 years old and was due a review in 2022 per its Inspector’s recommendation. That review is underway: Issues & Options for the JCS Review 2041 went out in Oct 2023, looking at additional growth locations (including possibly further expansion around Cheltenham and a new settlement at Flowerdown). So far, the existing JCS has not hindered development – Cheltenham has maintained over a 6-year housing land supply, buoyed by progress on the big allocations and lots of windfall flats in the town. The 2022 HDT was 151%. So while technically the plan is >5 years, its policies are largely still relevant (especially since the 2020 local plan refreshed many DM policies). Nonetheless, to avoid any future shortfall (given that NW Cheltenham is only just starting and might not deliver at anticipated rates), the timely adoption of the JCS Review (target ~2025/26) is needed. Potential risk factors include if Tewkesbury or Gloucester hit complications (e.g. flood constraints in Gloucester may force more growth to Cheltenham’s area). But as of now, all three councils are committed to the joint review. The plan risk for Cheltenham is thus low-moderate: current policies suffice, but by 2025 if the review hasn’t advanced, developers might start pushing unallocated sites. Assuming the review stays on schedule, Cheltenham will get an updated framework through 2041 with increased allocations (likely including an expanded Cyber Central Garden Village). Until then, the existing JCS and Cheltenham Plan are managing development adequately and NPPF default has not been a major issue.",

A new Local Plan 2041 has been in the works since 2019; a Preferred Option focusing growth in a new town at Sharpness was consulted on in 2022 but then paused, partly due to the nutrient neutrality embargo affecting the River Wye catchment. The plan process has recently restarted. Meanwhile, much of FoD’s housing delivery is stalled by the river pollution issue, leaving the district unable to meet targets. Until the plan is done and mitigation in place, the area is effectively under a development moratorium – the NPPF presumption doesn’t help if permissions can’t be granted. This is a high-risk situation that hinges on environmental resolutions and completing the new plan by 2025/26.",
    "notes": "Forest of Dean District currently relies on a Core Strategy (2012) and an Allocations Plan (2018). These provided for growth up to 2026 across the district’s towns (Cinderford, Coleford, Lydney) and some larger villages. However, since 2019 the LPA has been preparing a new Local Plan 2021–2041 to set a fresh strategy. A controversial Preferred Option emerged that heavily favored a new garden village at Sharpness (on FoD’s extreme south-eastern tip) to accommodate a big chunk of housing, rather than expanding the existing towns. This met resistance in local consultations in 2022. Complicating matters, a Natural England ruling in 2021 found the River Wye SAC is in poor condition, halting virtually all new housing in northern FoD (Cinderford area) until nutrient neutrality can be achieved. Thus, the council paused the plan process to gather more evidence and work on mitigation strategies. As of late 2023, they signalled intent to resume the Local Plan, likely adjusting the spatial distribution (possibly reducing reliance on Sharpness and focusing on Lydney which is outside the Wye catchment). The timeline now likely sees a new Reg 19 in 2024 and submission by 2025. In the interim, FoD’s housing supply is critically impacted: the HDT 2022 was 0% (housing delivery basically ceased in the affected catchment), and the district cannot show a 5-year supply. Yet the usual NPPF presumption is moot because the council simply cannot lawfully grant consents adding to the Wye’s nutrient load without mitigation. So the risk here is not typical speculative-building risk but rather a stagnation risk. The new plan is crucial as it will designate nutrient mitigation areas, update targets (which may need to be lower unless catchment solutions free up capacity), and allocate deliverable sites (likely more at Lydney which drains to the Severn estuary instead). Until then, FoD remains in limbo. It’s a high-risk scenario from a plan-making perspective because without resolution the council can’t meet legal requirements and could face designation or appeals citing non-determination. The bright spot is that being a two-plan district, any overspill from Gloucester/Cheltenham will probably bypass FoD due to these issues. But internally, unlocking sustainable development relies on getting the new plan and nutrient strategy in place. 2024 will be a decisive year. Overall, the current plan is outdated and largely ineffective under present constraints – risk is high until the new plan and environmental measures restore a functional planning regime.",

However, Gloucester faces severe housing land constraints (limited expansion room and high flood risk), so the JCS Review will be crucial to identify how growth post-2031 is handled (likely more reliance on Cheltenham/Tewkesbury). In the meantime, Gloucester is delivering regeneration schemes (e.g. King’s Quarter) and meeting targets – there’s no presumption issue. The JCS Review will ensure a longer-term strategy (possibly up to 2041) is agreed by 2025.",
    "notes": "Gloucester City shares the 2017 Joint Core Strategy (JCS) with Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, which provided the overarching strategy including urban extensions at Innsworth and Churchdown (in Tewkesbury borough) to help meet Gloucester’s needs. The city itself is tightly bounded, with Green Belt to north and east and Severn floodplain to west. In December 2022, Gloucester adopted its City Plan 2011-2031, allocating remaining sites within the city (mostly brownfield regenerations and some small greenfield on fringes). This completed the local plan coverage and enabled the council to demonstrate a healthy land supply (over 7 years). The city’s Housing Delivery Test for 2022 was 141%, reflecting strong output from sites like Bakers Quay and Kingsway. With the City Plan, Gloucester’s local policies are up-to-date. The focus now shifts to the JCS Review, which is underway for post-2031. Given Gloucester’s constraints, the review’s big question is how much growth can be accommodated within or adjacent to the city. The 2023 Issues consultation raised the possibility of a major new settlement at Stoke Orchard (Tewkesbury) partly to serve Gloucester’s longer term growth. Gloucester City will rely on the partnership to ensure its needs are met to 2041, as its own capacity is limited (most suitable sites are already used or allocated). But since that cooperation is active and formalized in the JCS, plan risk is low. There’s no immediate risk of speculative sprawl because outside Gloucester’s boundary is protected Green Belt or in Tewkesbury’s jurisdiction (where JCS policies still hold). So Gloucester’s planning context is stable and relatively low-risk. The only potential issue is if the JCS Review significantly faltered, Gloucester could eventually face a supply shortfall late in the 2020s. However, progress so far indicates adoption of the review by 2025. In summary, Gloucester has an up-to-date local plan (2022) and is engaged in an on-track joint strategic review, making its situation secure under the NPPF at present.",

    "notes": "The Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) adopted the Dartmoor Local Plan 2018–2036 on 3 December 2021. This plan covers the entire National Park and sets out policies balancing conservation with meeting local needs (primarily affordable housing for local communities and limited employment space). It replaced the previous 2004/2011 plans. Being only 3-4 years old, the plan is very much up-to-date. It identifies small-scale housing sites in larger villages (e.g. Ashburton, Buckfastleigh) and includes a rural exception housing approach for local occupancy. The DNPA has a small housing requirement (around 65 homes/year) which is being met through this plan. Delivery is on track (the Authority delivered 103% of its modest housing target in 2022) and a 5-year supply exists primarily due to windfall and allocated village sites. The Dartmoor plan also includes robust environmental protections aligning with the 2021 NPPF (e.g. strong controls on major development per para 176). As such, the plan faces no NPPF default issues. The National Park is not subject to mandated 5-year reviews in the same way as high-growth councils, but DNPA will likely still review its policies by 2026 to ensure compliance with any new national park management plan objectives. For now, plan risk is very low – the policy framework is current and suited to the NP context, and development pressure is relatively minimal and catered for. The only foreseeable change might come if government were to introduce new requirements (e.g. biodiversity net gain) that the DNPA might incorporate via a light touch update, but nothing that undermines the overall plan. In summary, Dartmoor’s Local Plan is sound, up-to-date, and not in need of replacement before the late 2020s.",

It remains largely fit for purpose, focusing on local needs housing and conservation, but at 8 years old it is approaching the time for a review. The National Park Authority has not signalled a new plan yet; presumably an update will be undertaken around 2025-26. Given very low development pressure and a unique policy environment (e.g. nearly all housing is rural exceptions for local occupancy), the plan’s age has not led to any significant issues under the NPPF. It still effectively guides decisions, and Exmoor easily meets its minimal housing targets via windfalls and conversions.",
    "notes": "The Exmoor National Park Authority (ENPA) adopted its current Local Plan in July 2017, covering 2011–2031. Like other national parks, its plan emphasizes environmental protection and only permits new development in exceptional or locally justified circumstances. For housing, Exmoor’s plan set a low annual target (~20 dwellings/year) all to be delivered as local needs affordable housing or succession farm dwellings, etc. This model has worked within the Park: most housing comes from barn conversions or small exception sites, and the NPA consistently meets this need. Because of the small scale and the alignment with NPPF’s approach to National Parks, the plan’s policies remain effective 8 years on. There have been no significant development proposals that test the limits of the plan (no major housing schemes or industry that would invoke NPPF para 177 because none would be allowed or proposed). The plan likely requires a review in the next few years to roll forward beyond 2031 and incorporate updated climate change mitigations, but the ENPA has limited resources so may coordinate this with the update of the Park Management Plan timeline. Until then, the risk posed by an “outdated” plan is negligible – Exmoor’s protected status means general presumption in favor of development doesn’t apply strongly (footnote 60 of NPPF), and the park hasn’t seen any appeals exploiting the plan’s age. Essentially, development management carries on with the 2017 policies unchallenged. So, while technically beyond 5 years, Exmoor’s plan can be considered effectively up-to-date in practice. Plan risk is extremely low; updates will be driven more by new environmental standards (like stronger climate adaptation measures for heritage buildings) rather than by any urgent land supply or development pressure issue.",

Dartford’s side is up-to-date. This split framework adds complexity but the situation will improve once Gravesham’s emerging Local Plan is adopted, bringing the whole Garden City under current policies.",
    "notes": "Ebbsfleet Development Corporation was established to oversee a cross-boundary Garden City spanning parts of Dartford and Gravesham. It relies on Dartford’s Local Plan (adopted 2024) and Gravesham’s Local Plan Core Strategy (2014) for statutory policy. Dartford’s plan (which specifically allocates Ebbsfleet Central etc.) is up-to-date and Ebbsfleet DC applies it in determining applications on Dartford side. In contrast, Gravesham’s 2014 plan is over 5 years old and didn’t foresee the scale of Ebbsfleet development; Gravesham is working on a new plan (Reg 19 due 2024) to rectify this. In the interim, Ebbsfleet DC uses the non-statutory Ebbsfleet Implementation Framework 2017 as a coordinated masterplan (covering design, infrastructure phasing) but this has no legal weight in lieu of a local plan. As a result, for big sites like Ebbsfleet Central and Eastern Quarry, the EDC has had to negotiate within the patchwork of one up-to-date plan (Dartford) and one outdated plan (Gravesham). This hasn’t stopped progress – thousands of homes are underway – but it poses some planning risk (e.g. challenge potential if decisions in Gravesham area rely on older policies). The risk is being managed: EDC works closely with Gravesham, and major permissions (such as for eastern Ebbsfleet residential schemes) include comprehensive conditions aligning with the masterplan. By 2025, once Gravesham’s new Local Plan is adopted, Ebbsfleet will fully benefit from current local policy across all areas. In summary, Ebbsfleet’s planning status is atypical: there is effectively a temporary policy vacuum on roughly half the area, mitigated by the EDC’s framework and Dartford’s modern plan. The resolution is in sight via Gravesham’s plan review. The situation highlights the need for unified planning but so far has not halted Ebbsfleet’s development momentum. Plan risk for EDC is moderate now and expected to be low once the remaining borough plan catches up.",

That could lead to inconsistencies or default NPPF tests in some cases, but the council will manage via using the most up-to-date evidence and quickly progressing the unified plan.",
    "notes": "Cumberland Council is a new unitary combining the former districts of Carlisle, Allerdale, and Copeland (excluding the part in Lake District NP). It therefore inherited multiple local plans. Copeland’s new Local Plan 2021–2038 was adopted by Cumberland Council in April 2024, giving up-to-date coverage for the Whitehaven/Copeland area. Carlisle’s City Local Plan (2015–2030) adopted in 2016 now falls under Cumberland – it’s somewhat dated but largely delivered (Carlisle met its targets with the garden village at St Cuthbert’s well underway). Allerdale had a 2014 Core Strategy and a 2018 Site Allocations Plan; those are around 5-9 years old, still generally effective for towns like Workington/Maryport, but due for review. Cumberland Council’s priority is to create one new Cumberland Local Plan to cover the whole authority. According to its March 2024 Local Development Scheme, work commenced in 2023 and a Reg18 Issues consultation is expected in 2024. This new plan will run likely to 2040 and reconcile the varying policies and growth targets of its predecessor areas (e.g. align housing distribution across the former district boundaries). In the interim, planning decisions refer to the saved policies of the existing plans: in practice, the Copeland area has up-to-date policies (so no issues there), while Carlisle/Allerdale areas must lean on somewhat older policies. Where those are silent or out-of-date, Cumberland can use NPPF (e.g. to apply the Standard Method for any five-year supply calc, which in Carlisle’s case actually lowers the requirement since the 2016 plan had higher housing targets). The council is also applying recent evidence uniformly (for example, a new county-wide housing need study) to inform decisions across the patch. This patchwork isn’t ideal but is manageable in the short term. The biggest risk would be any major proposal that spans the old boundaries – but those are unlikely. The presumption could apply in parts of Carlisle/Allerdale if land supply dips, but both had relatively healthy supplies at last count (Carlisle ~6 years, Allerdale ~5.5). The prompt progression of the Cumberland Local Plan should mitigate long-term risk. Overall, while Cumberland’s planning framework is currently fragmented, the situation is under control: one-third of the area is covered by a brand-new plan (Copeland), and no area is completely lacking a plan. The key is unifying and updating them in the next few years, which is underway. Thus plan risk is moderate during this transition, expected to fall to low once the new plan is adopted.",

    "notes": "Cotswold District Council adopted its Local Plan (2011–2031) in August 2018. That plan was broadly compliant with the 2012 NPPF but by 2020 the Council declared a Climate Emergency and decided to partially update the plan to be *Green to the Core*. A Partial Update consultation took place in 2022–23, proposing strengthened environmental policies and minor tweaks to allocations. Concurrently, because the plan’s end date is 2031, the Council has started scoping a full new Local Plan 2026–2041 (the Local Development Scheme indicates preparation ramping up in 2024–25). As of 2025, the adopted plan is slightly out-of-date in terms of housing need (Standard Method suggests a higher annual figure). Cotswold’s housing delivery has been borderline (2022 HDT ~95%) and its 5-year land supply is marginal. Thus, some weight is given to the NPPF presumption on appeal. The Partial Update is intended to extend the life of the 2018 plan until the new plan can be adopted (likely by 2026). Overall, risk is moderate: policies are aging, but the Council’s active updates and generally positive delivery mean the situation is under control. Once the new plan is in place, Cotswold will have an up-to-date framework emphasizing sustainability.",
