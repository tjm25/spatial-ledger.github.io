    <h1>Spatial Ledger Analysis: Bassetlaw Local Plan 2020-2038</h1>
    <p><em>Adopted: 29 May 2024 | Plan Period: 2020-2038</em></p>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <h2>Overall Verdict</h2>
        <p>Bassetlaw's Plan sets an <span class="bold-green">ambitious housing target</span> well above the minimum required, linking homes to jobs. However, delivery relies heavily on <span class="bold-red">low-density</span>, late-starting urban extensions, while major brownfield regeneration is deferred, and a high number of <span class="bold-red">subjective design, heritage, and landscape policies</span> create significant risk that the headline target will be undermined in practice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="metric-flags">
        <div class="flag flag-green">Target vs Need: GOOD</div>
        <div class="flag flag-amber">Spatial Strategy: FAIR</div>
        <div class="flag flag-red">Policy Blockers: HIGH RISK</div>
        <div class="flag flag-red">Density Delivery: POOR</div>
        <div class="flag flag-amber">Brownfield First: WEAK</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>1. Housing Target & Delivery: Ambition Meets Risk</h3>
        <p class="section-summary">The Plan sets a housing target significantly higher than the government's minimum figure, linking it directly to economic growth needs. While laudable, the ability to actually deliver this hinges on overcoming policy constraints and ensuring allocated sites perform.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Annual Target:</strong> Minimum 9,720 homes over 18 years = <span class="bold-green">540 dwellings per annum (dpa)</span>. <cite>(Policy ST1.2, p38)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Target vs OAN:</strong> The Standard Method OAN is calculated at 288 dpa. The Plan target is <span class="bold-green">87% higher</span> than this minimum baseline. <cite>(Para 5.1.21, p29)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Justification:</strong> The higher target is explicitly justified by the need to support forecast jobs growth (9,699 jobs). <cite>(Para 5.1.22, p29)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Land Supply:</strong> The Plan identifies land for 11,195 homes, providing a <span class="bold-green">15% buffer</span> over the 9,720 target (including windfall/small sites). <cite>(Figure 6, p31; Para 5.1.30, p31)</cite></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="scorecard"><strong>Target Score: A-</strong> (High ambition, good justification, buffer included, but delivery risks exist elsewhere).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. Spatial Strategy: Towns First, But Brownfield Later?</h3>
        <p class="section-summary">Growth is correctly focused on the main towns and large urban extensions. However, major brownfield regeneration opportunities like Cottam Power Station are deferred beyond the plan period, potentially delaying sustainable development on previously used land.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Clear focus on Main Towns (Worksop, Retford, Harworth & Bircotes), then Large/Small Rural Settlements. <cite>(Policy ST1, p38)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Main Towns receive ~70% of total growth. New allocations heavily favour Worksop and Retford urban extensions. <cite>(Figure 7, p33; Para 5.1.38, p32)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Urban Extensions:</strong> Two large sites provide the bulk of new allocations: HS1 Peaks Hill Farm (655 homes by 2038) and HS13 Ordsall South (960 homes by 2038). <cite>(Policy ST13, p78; Paras 5.1.42, 7.2.4, 7.13.3)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Rural Growth:</strong> Managed via % uplifts (20% Large, 5% Small Settlements), aiming to avoid past 'over-burdening'. <cite>(Policy ST2, p41; Para 5.2.4, p39)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Deferred Brownfield:</strong> <span class="bold-red">Cottam Power Station is designated a "Priority Regeneration Area" but development is expected *beyond* the plan period and depends on future review</span>. STEP fusion site at West Burton also deferred. <cite>(Policy ST4, p48; Paras 5.3.11, 5.3.21, 3.24)</cite></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="scorecard"><strong>Spatial Score: B-</strong> (Good town focus, but deferring major brownfield sites is a significant weakness).</div>
    </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h3>3. Site Allocations & Density: Undermining the Target?</h3>
        <p class="section-summary">While sufficient land is allocated, the planned densities on the crucial large urban extensions appear extremely low, directly contradicting the Plan's own minimum density guidance for towns and making the overall housing target much harder to achieve efficiently.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strategic Sites:</strong> HS1 Peaks Hill Farm (Worksop North) and HS13 Ordsall South (Retford South) are the key delivery vehicles for new allocations.</li>
            <li><strong>Planned Density:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>HS1: 655 homes (by 2038) on ~45ha residential = <span class="bold-red">~14.5 dph</span>.</li>
                    <li>HS13: 960 homes (by 2038) on ~106ha = <span class="bold-red">~9 dph</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                 <cite>(Calculated from site areas/yields in Policies 14 & 25, site context paras 7.2.12 & 7.13.8)</cite>
            </li>
             <li><strong>Policy Contradiction:</strong> Policy ST33 states densities in Main Towns should be a <span class="bold-green">minimum of 30 dph</span>, unless adverse effects on character/heritage/natural assets. The planned densities for HS1 and HS13 are drastically lower than this minimum. <cite>(Policy ST33.1.b.i, p136)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Delivering strategic sites at such low densities requires significantly more land, makes infrastructure provision less efficient, and puts pressure on meeting the 540 dpa target sustainably. It suggests either the 30 dph policy is not intended to apply robustly or the site yields are underestimated.</li>
        </ul>
         <div class="callout">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> The plan calls for a minimum 30 dph in towns but allocates its largest housing sites at densities potentially as low as 9-15 dph. This risks inefficient land use and undermines the headline housing target.
        </div>
        <div class="scorecard"><strong>Density Score: F</strong> (Planned densities on key sites are unacceptably low and contradict stated policy).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>4. Hidden Constraints: The Discretionary Danger Zone</h3>
        <p class="section-summary">The Plan contains numerous policies covering design, landscape, and heritage that rely heavily on subjective judgements. This creates uncertainty for applicants and provides ample opportunity for development to be slowed or blocked, irrespective of the housing target.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design Quality (ST33):</strong> Requires development to "respect the local context," "complement" existing form, scale, materials etc. Allows density below 30 dph if needed to protect character/heritage/natural assets. <span class="bold-red">Highly subjective terms</span>. <cite>(Policy ST33, p136)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Landscape Character (ST35):</strong> Requires protection and enhancement of defined landscape character zones and adherence to specific "Landscape Actions". <cite>(Policy ST35, p140)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Heritage Assets (ST40, 41):</strong> Gives "great weight" to designated assets and requires assessment of impact on setting, including views. Non-designated assets also require consideration. <cite>(Policy ST40, p154; Policy 41, p155)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Green Gaps (ST36):</strong> Designates specific areas between settlements to prevent physical or visual coalescence, requiring landscape statements to justify any development. <cite>(Policy ST36, p141)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Risk:</strong> The cumulative effect of these policies provides multiple avenues for decision-makers to resist development based on subjective interpretation of terms like "respect," "enhance," "appropriate," or "adverse impact".</li>
        </ul>
         <div class="callout">
            <strong>Policy Quote Watch:</strong> "respect the local context", "complements the landform", "positively conserve or enhance a historic designed landscape", "maintain, conserve, sustain... designated or non-designated assets". <cite>(ST33, ST40)</cite> - These subjective phrases empower refusal based on interpretation.
        </div>
        <div class="scorecard"><strong>Certainty Score: D</strong> (Subjective policies create significant implementation risk).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>5. Trajectory & Delivery: Backloaded and Uncertain</h3>
        <p class="section-summary">The housing trajectory relies on existing commitments initially, with the major new allocated sites not expected to deliver significantly until the middle of the plan period (post-2026). Reliance on standard windfall assumptions adds further uncertainty.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phasing:</strong> New allocations HS1 and HS13 expected to start delivering homes around 2026-27. <cite>(Paras 7.2.4, 7.13.3; Appendix 3)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Windfall Reliance:</strong> Assumes 76 dpa from windfall from 2026/27 onwards. <cite>(Para 5.1.27, p30)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Small Sites:</strong> Includes a front-loaded allowance of 182 dpa for small sites (under 10 units) until 2025-26. <cite>(Para 5.1.28, p30)</cite></li>
            <li><strong>Overall Shape:</strong> Delivery appears relatively stable on paper until the final years, but heavily dependent on the large sites delivering consistently once they start. <cite>(Appendix 3, p251)</cite></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="scorecard"><strong>Delivery Confidence: C</strong> (Appears sufficient on paper, but backloading of strategic sites and standard windfall reliance carries risk).</div>
