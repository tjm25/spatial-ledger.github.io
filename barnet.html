    <h2>Verdict: Hindering Delivery</h2>
    <p>This Local Plan presents ambitious housing numbers on paper but potentially undermines delivery through a constrained official target, significant reliance on less certain sites, and a web of subjective design, character, and heritage policies that create uncertainty and risk blocking much-needed homes.</p>

  <div class="section" id="targets">
    <h2><span class="rating average">Target Trouble? Ambition Capped</span></h2>
    <p>The Plan sets a minimum target of 35,460 new homes over 15 years (2021-2036), equating to <strong>2,364 homes per year</strong> <span class="policy-ref">(Policy BSS01a, p23; Para 4.4.1, p27)</span>. This figure is derived directly from the London Plan target, which often represents a politically negotiated minimum rather than the full, objectively assessed housing need (OAN) for the borough. While the Plan identifies potential capacity for more homes (43,700 in Table 5, p31), the official target remains the baseline.</p>
    <p>Critically, the target appears to be set based on what can be achieved *without* reviewing Green Belt boundaries <span class="policy-ref">(Policy ECC06, p190)</span>. While Green Belt protection is national policy, refusing even to review potentially low-value Green Belt land near existing infrastructure limits the Plan's ambition from the outset and likely means the <strong>full housing need is not being planned for</strong>. Meeting only the minimum requirement in a high-demand borough like Barnet risks worsening the housing crisis.</p>

    <h2><span class="rating good">Right Places, But Enough Ambition?</span></h2>
    <p>The Plan rightly concentrates growth in the most sustainable locations: designated Growth Areas (Brent Cross, Colindale, Edgware, Cricklewood, Brent Cross West), District Town Centres, and around transport hubs <span class="policy-ref">(Policy BSS01C, p23; Policy GSS01C, p34)</span>. This focus on urban areas and public transport corridors aligns well with good design principles, aiming to maximize the use of existing infrastructure like the Northern Line, Thameslink, and potential future schemes like the West London Orbital.</p>
    <p>However, while the locations are appropriate, questions remain about whether the Plan is ambitious enough *within* these areas. The identified housing capacity (43,700 homes) relies heavily on large, complex regeneration sites (Growth Areas account for over 50% of the total - 22,790 homes, Table 5, p31). Furthermore, there's a notable reliance on less certain sources: <strong>5,010 homes (11.5%) from small sites</strong> under 0.25ha and <strong>3,980 homes (9%) from estate renewal/infill</strong> <span class="policy-ref">(Table 5, p31; Para 4.8.5, p30)</span>. While small sites are important, relying on them for such a significant proportion introduces delivery risk compared to proactively allocating more land or enabling higher densities on larger sites.</p>

   <div class="section" id="constraints">
    <h2><span class="rating red">The Policy Gauntlet: Death by a Thousand Cuts?</span></h2>
    <p>Despite the focus on growth locations, the Plan contains numerous policies that introduce significant uncertainty and risk blocking development. Chapter 6 (Character, Design and Heritage) is laden with subjective requirements. Policy CDH01 demands development "Respond sensitively to the distinctive local character and design" and "Use materials of a suitable quality...to respect local character and setting" <span class="policy-ref">(p96)</span>. Policy CDH08 gives "great weight" to conserving heritage assets <span class="policy-ref">(p111, p116)</span>.</p>
    <p>While good design and heritage are important, such discretionary language ("sensitively", "respect", "appropriate") gives huge leeway for refusal based on subjective judgement, undermining the certainty needed for investment. Policy CDH04 restricts Tall Buildings (8+ storeys) to specific locations, limiting intensification potential elsewhere <span class="policy-ref">(p101, p105)</span>. Policy HOU03 actively restricts the conversion or redevelopment of larger family homes, even in accessible locations, directly preventing gentle density increases <span class="policy-ref">(p76, p80)</span>. This network of potentially restrictive policies acts as a significant barrier to optimising sites and meeting housing need efficiently.</p>
     <div class="callout">
       <strong>Policy Blocker Example (HOU03):</strong> "The Council will apply these criteria to any proposals for the demolition and redevelopment of larger homes." <span class="policy-ref">(p80)</span> - Directly protects larger (often under-occupied) houses from being replaced with more, smaller homes, hindering efficient land use.

  <div class="section" id="contradictions">
    <h2><span class="rating average">Conflicting Priorities: Growth vs Protectionism</span></h2>
    <p>The Barnet Local Plan embodies a fundamental tension: the stated goal of significant housing growth versus strong protectionist policies for existing neighbourhood character, heritage, and Green Belt. While balancing objectives is necessary, the Plan often elevates constraints without explicitly acknowledging the housing delivery trade-offs.</p>
    <p>For instance, the Plan aims for "optimising the use of land and site capacity through a design-led approach" <span class="policy-ref">(e.g. GSS02, p39)</span> but simultaneously introduces policies (like HOU03 on larger homes, CDH04 on tall buildings, and the emphasis in CDH01/CDH08 on character/heritage) that directly limit optimisation. Green Belt protection <span class="policy-ref">(ECC06, p188)</span> is treated as nearly absolute, preventing discussion about using less sensitive Green Belt areas to meet needs. These conflicts create ambiguity and suggest that, when push comes to shove, <strong>housing delivery may lose out to subjective interpretations of 'character' or protectionism</strong>.</p>
     <div class="callout">
       <strong>Contradiction?</strong> "Integral to the Council’s ambitions for growth is the need to ensure that new development is of high quality and responds to local character." <span class="policy-ref">(Para 6.3.1, p90)</span> - This laudable aim becomes problematic when 'responding to local character' is used to prevent necessary change and density required for growth.
     </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="sites">
    <h2>Site Allocations: Major Sites Key, But Are Densities Maximised?</h2>
    <p>Annex 1 details site allocations, with significant capacity identified in the Growth Areas like Brent Cross (7,420 homes), Colindale (5,190), and Edgware (4,740) <span class="policy-ref">(Table 5, p31; GSS02-GSS06, p39-51)</span>. These large, complex sites are crucial for delivery but also subject to market fluctuations and infrastructure challenges (e.g., Brent Cross retail deferral, p37). The Plan provides a density matrix <span class="policy-ref">(p253)</span> linking density to PTAL and setting (Suburban, Urban, Central).</p>
    <p>While providing guidance, these density ranges may not be sufficiently ambitious, especially in 'Urban' or 'Central' locations near transport. For example, is 45-185 units/hectare truly optimising capacity in an 'Urban' setting with good PTAL (4-6)? The reliance on a "design-led approach" <span class="policy-ref">(p35, D. Build to Rent; p101, Para 6.17.3)</span>, while positive in principle, could allow lower densities if subjective character concerns override quantitative housing need. The Plan needs to ensure allocated sites deliver their maximum potential contribution.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="trajectory">
    <h2>Delivery Trajectory: Ambitious Mid-Term, Back-End Risks?</h2>
    <p>The Housing Trajectory (Figure 3, p33) and delivery table (Table 5, p31) show identified supply (43,700) exceeding the minimum target (35,460). Delivery peaks significantly in years 6-10 (21,610 homes planned), relying heavily on the large Growth Area schemes coming forward as anticipated. Delivery then drops sharply in years 11-15 (10,410 homes).</p>
    <p>This profile indicates a significant dependency on major projects delivering in the medium term. Any delays or market downturns impacting these key sites could jeopardise the overall trajectory. Furthermore, the substantial contribution from small sites (5,010) throughout the period adds an element of uncertainty, as windfall and small site delivery is inherently less predictable than delivery on large allocated sites. While not showing a planned shortfall against the minimum target, the trajectory highlights the risks associated with relying on large schemes and less certain sources.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="language-risk">
    <h2>Policy Language: Too Much Wiggle Room?</h2>
    <p>Throughout the plan, particularly in crucial areas like design, character, heritage, and amenity assessment, the policy language uses terms like "appropriate", "sensitively", "respect", "where possible", "unacceptable impact". While standard planning terminology, the frequency and strategic placement of such subjective wording create significant implementation risk.</p>
    <p>These terms provide decision-makers (and opponents of development) with considerable leeway to argue against schemes that might otherwise comply with numerical targets or core strategic aims. This lack of clarity undermines the planning system's role in providing certainty for investment and enabling development. Policies need to be clearer about what *is* acceptable, rather than relying heavily on subjective interpretation, to truly facilitate housing delivery.</p>
