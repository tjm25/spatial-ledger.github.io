    <h1>Spatial Ledger Verdict: Eastleigh Local Plan (2016-2036)</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        This Local Plan was knowingly adopted with a significant housing shortfall, kicking the can down the road by relying on past permissions and mandating an immediate review.

        <h2>Housing Target: Falling Short from Day One</h2>
        <p>Eastleigh acknowledges its housing need but adopts a plan that <strong class="highlight">explicitly fails to meet it</strong>. While setting a target aligned with objective need, the numbers simply don't add up, creating a deficit from the moment of adoption.</p>
        <p>The Plan aims for <strong class="amberlight">14,580 homes (729 per year)</strong> between 2016-2036 (<span class="policy-ref">Policy S2</span>), reflecting the identified need. However, the Plan itself admits this target won't be met. The identified supply totals only 11,966 homes, leaving a <strong class="highlight">shortfall of 2,614 dwellings</strong> (<span class="policy-ref">para 4.11</span>). This failure is blamed on the removal of a proposed Strategic Growth Option (SGO) during the examination process. Adopting a plan known to be insufficient is a significant failure in planning responsibility.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Key Numbers (Policy S2 & Trajectory p33):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Target (2016-2036): 14,580</li>

        <strong>Direct Admission of Failure:</strong> "The pattern of delivery set out in Strategic Policy S2 results in a shortfall of 2,614 dwellings against the target of 14,580... This is primarily due to the deletion, as recommended by the Local Plan Examination Inspector, of the Strategic Growth Option... The Inspector recommended that this shortfall be addressed in an early review of the local plan." (<span class="policy-ref">para 4.11, p31</span>).
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Where Will Homes Go?: Past Permissions & Tight Constraints</h2>
        <p>The plan leans heavily on large greenfield sites that <strong class="amberlight">already had planning permission</strong> before this plan was finalised. New allocations are minimal and scattered. Significant areas are effectively sterilised by protective policies like Settlement Gaps.</p>
        <p>Major delivery relies on sites like Stoneham Park, Horton Heath, and Boorley Green (<span class="policy-ref">Policy S3a</span>), which secured consent under previous processes. The mere <strong class="highlight">732 newly allocated homes</strong> (<span class="policy-ref">Policy S3c</span>) are spread across smaller urban and edge-of-settlement sites (detailed in Chapter 6). While brownfield is mentioned first (<span class="policy-ref">para 3.6</span>), the actual delivery strategy doesn't reflect this prioritisation for *new* supply. Crucially, <span class="policy-ref">Settlement Gap</span> policies (<span class="policy-ref">S6</span>) and restrictive <span class="policy-ref">Countryside</span> policies (<span class="policy-ref">S5</span>) severely limit where new housing can even be considered, protecting separation often at the expense of meeting needs near existing infrastructure. The Hamble peninsula is explicitly excluded from significant growth (<span class="policy-ref">para 3.7(l)</span>).</p>
         <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Key Spatial Constraints:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="policy-ref">Policy S5</span>: Restricts development in the countryside to very specific uses.</li>
                <li><span class="policy-ref">Policy S6</span>: Protects defined gaps between settlements (see Fig 2, p42), severely limiting development potential in these areas.</li>
                <li><span class="policy-ref">Policy S7</span>: Protects the coast.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hidden Blockers & Policy Hurdles</h2>
        <p>Beyond the obvious shortfall, a web of policies creates further risk. Restrictive criteria on design, character, density, and environmental factors provide ample opportunity to delay or refuse much-needed housing, even on allocated sites.</p>
        <p>Policies like <span class="policy-ref">DM1 (General Criteria)</span> demand development is 'compatible with' and 'respects' local character, terms which are subjective and can be used to block denser, more efficient development. While <span class="policy-ref">DM23</span> sets a minimum density of 40 dwellings per hectare, it includes caveats allowing lower densities if 'justified', potentially weakening the standard. Numerous policies require detailed assessments (Habitats Regulations Assessment, Flood Risk, Transport, Heritage, Ecology - e.g. <span class="policy-ref">DM5, DM11, DM12, DM13</span>) adding cost, time, and uncertainty. <span class="policy-ref">Settlement Gaps (S6)</span> act as a major, explicit blocker, functioning much like Green Belt.</p>
         <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Potential Blockers:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Subjective design/character tests (<span class="policy-ref">DM1</span>).</li>
                <li>Weakened density targets (<span class="policy-ref">DM23</span>).</li>
                <li>Strict protection of Settlement Gaps (<span class="policy-ref">S6</span>) and Countryside (<span class="policy-ref">S5</span>).</li>
                <li>Extensive buffer requirements for nature sites (<span class="policy-ref">DM11</span>).</li>
                <li>Complex assessment requirements (HRA, FRA, TRA etc.).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contradictions & Trade-Offs: Papering Over the Cracks</h2>
        <p>The Plan's central contradiction is <strong class="highlight">admitting its housing target failure while still being adopted</strong>. It acknowledges the need for an immediate review, effectively confirming the adopted document is inadequate from the start. Environmental and landscape protections appear prioritised over meeting housing needs within the plan period.</p>
        <p>The Council claims a 'proactive and sustainable approach' (Foreword, p3) while adopting a plan with a known 2,614 home deficit. Objectives for housing delivery (<span class="policy-ref">Objective x</span>) clash with the reality of the allocated supply (<span class="policy-ref">S2/S3</span>) and restrictive spatial policies (<span class="policy-ref">S5/S6</span>). The reliance on an "early review" (<span class="policy-ref">para 4.12</span>) is an admission that difficult decisions about housing location have been deferred, not resolved.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="callout">
        <strong>Kicking the Can:</strong> "This shortfall... should be addressed through an early review of the local plan. Accordingly, the Council will commence an update of this Local Plan within 1 year of its adoption." (<span class="policy-ref">para 4.12, p32</span>) - Why adopt a failing plan only to immediately review it?
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Site Allocations & Delivery: A Plan Reliant on the Past</h2>
        <p>The vast majority of housing delivery anticipated in this Plan (<strong class="amberlight">over 90% of the supply identified excluding completions</strong>) comes from sites that ALREADY had planning permission or a resolution to grant before this plan was adopted. The Plan allocates precious few new sites itself.</p>
        <p>Policies <span class="policy-ref">S2</span> and <span class="policy-ref">S3</span> make this clear: 7,700 homes are from existing commitments vs only 732 homes from new allocations in Chapter 6. These new allocations (e.g. <span class="policy-ref">FO1-3, BU1-5, CF1-4, AL1-2, HE2-6, BO1-4, WE1-3</span>) are mostly small to medium scale and insufficient to address the overall need or the identified shortfall. Their deliverability depends on navigating the various Development Management policies.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="section">
        <h2>Trajectory & Delivery Expectations: Shortfall Baked In</h2>
        <p>The housing trajectory (summarised on p33) explicitly maps out the failure to meet the target, confirming the <strong class="highlight">2,614 dwelling shortfall by 2036</strong>. There are no optimistic assumptions here – the plan simply doesn't allocate enough land.</p>
        <p>Because delivery relies so heavily on pre-existing permissions, the supply of *newly planned* homes dwindles significantly towards the end of the plan period. This lack of a long-term pipeline makes the mandatory "early review" (<span class="policy-ref">para 4.12</span>) absolutely critical, but raises questions about the purpose of adopting this version of the plan at all.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Policy Language & Implementation Risk</h2>
        <p>While some strategic policies are clear (like the housing numbers), many Development Management (DM) policies rely on <strong class="amberlight">discretionary language</strong>. Terms like 'unacceptable impact', 'appropriate', 'sympathetic', 'significant adverse effect' lack precision and give considerable leeway to decision-makers, potentially creating inconsistency and risk for applicants proposing needed development.</p>
        <p>The requirement for numerous, potentially complex, assessments (HRA, FRA, TRA, Noise, Air Quality, Heritage Statements etc.) across many policies adds layers of process that can slow down or deter development, particularly on smaller sites. While necessary in principle, their cumulative burden and potential for subjective interpretation needs careful monitoring to ensure they don't become de facto blockers.</p>
