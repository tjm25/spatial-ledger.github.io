                        <span class="emoji">🔍</span> What is The Spatial Ledger?
                    </button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Every Local Plan makes promises: how many homes will be built, where growth will happen, and
                            which priorities will guide development. But are these promises being kept?</p>
                        <p>The Spatial Ledger cuts through the complexity. We examine Local Plans across England,
                            scrutinising the details to reveal what they truly commit to, what remains unsaid, and where
                            policies might quietly conflict.</p>
                        <p>We focus on critical questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does the housing target genuinely meet local needs?</li>
                            <li>Is development distributed fairly across towns and villages?</li>
                            <li>Are constraints presented as unchangeable facts or as policy choices?</li>
                            <li>Do the specific site allocations align with the plan's overall vision?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Spatial Ledger provides clear, evidence-based answers, creating a public record for
                            accountability.</p>

                        <span class="emoji">🧾</span> Why Does This Matter?
                    </button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Planning decisions shape our communities profoundly – influencing where we can afford to
                            live, the jobs available, and who feels included or left behind.</p>
                        <p>Yet, these crucial decisions are often buried within lengthy, technical documents. This
                            opacity makes the planning system difficult for most people to engage with – until a housing
                            crisis or controversial development makes the consequences unavoidable.</p>
                        <p>The Spatial Ledger aims to change that. By making local planning promises and policies
                            transparent and understandable, we make the system harder to ignore and easier to hold
                            accountable.</p>

                        <p>Our process is straightforward:</p>

                            <li>We meticulously read Local Plans and related evidence documents.</li>
                            <li>We identify vague commitments, internal contradictions, and policies that may hinder
                                rather than help sustainable growth.</li>
                            <li>We compare stated ambitions with allocated sites, and targets with likely delivery
                                outcomes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We then publish our findings clearly, one page per Local Planning Authority, creating a vital
