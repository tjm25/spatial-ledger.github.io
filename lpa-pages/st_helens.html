            <p>The plan sets a housing target of <span class="highlight">486 homes per year</span> (10,206 total 2016-2037). Positively, this aligns with the higher end of their own evidence (SHMA Update 2018) which accounted for economic growth, rather than just using the lower standard method figure (399 dpa). Crucially, the plan acknowledges that meeting this need requires releasing land from the Green Belt, which it proceeds to do.</p>

            <p>While the plan sets minimum densities (good), standard policies on design, character, heritage, and amenity contain <span class="highlight">discretionary wording</span> ("respect", "enhance", "unacceptable harm"). This gives significant leeway to decision-makers and could be used to block or delay developments, even on allocated sites, based on subjective judgements.</p>
            <p>Policy LPD05 is particularly restrictive regarding extensions and replacements of buildings in the *remaining* Green Belt, going beyond basic NPPF exceptions with specific volume caps (30%), potentially hindering appropriate rural development and adaptation.</p>

            <p>Protections for remaining environmental and heritage assets are standard. The risk lies not in outright contradiction, but in whether these protections are applied disproportionately during decision-making to frustrate development on allocated sites.</p>

            <p>A significant portion of the housing supply relies on a few large strategic housing sites (SHS), notably 4HA (Bold Forest Garden Suburb), 6HA (Cowley Hill), and 10HA (Moss Nook). While the plan includes buffers for non-delivery, large sites often face complex infrastructure requirements and longer build-out times, posing a delivery risk.</p>
            <p>The plan allocates sufficient sites on paper, including former Green Belt land, but the actual delivery rate will depend heavily on these major schemes progressing without significant delays.</p>

            <p>The housing trajectory <span class="policy-ref">(Table 4.10 / Figure 4.3)</span> shows delivery peaking mid-plan and relying heavily on large sites coming forward in later years. The Bold Forest Garden Suburb (4HA) is particularly backloaded, with only 510 of nearly 3,000 homes expected by 2037, based on a cautious 7-year lead-in and 60 dpa build rate.</p>
            <p>While the plan shows a 5.1-year housing land supply at adoption <span class="policy-ref">(Table 4.12)</span>, this could quickly erode if large strategic sites face delays. The reliance on these sites introduces significant delivery risk later in the plan period.</p>
             <div class="evidence">

                    <li><span class="policy-ref">Table 4.10 / Figure 4.3:</span> Trajectory shows peaks around 2027-2030, lower delivery at start and end.</li>

               Delivery Gamble: Relying on huge sites like the Bold Forest Garden Suburb (expecting only 17% delivery by 2037) makes the plan's overall target vulnerable to delays. Will St Helens maintain a 5-year supply throughout the plan?
