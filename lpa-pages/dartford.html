  <h1>Spatial Ledger Analysis: The Dartford Plan (Adopted April 2024)</h1>

  <div class="summary-box">
    This Local Plan sets an ambitious housing target above minimum requirements and correctly focuses development on urban brownfield regeneration areas, but its success hinges entirely on delivering complex large-scale sites like Ebbsfleet, while standard design policies and specific restrictions on conversions could quietly hinder smaller-scale delivery.
  </div>

    <div class="flag amber">Target vs Need: Above OAN</div>
    <div class="flag green">Spatial Fairness: Good (Brownfield Focus)</div>
    <div class="flag amber">Policy Blockers: Moderate Risk</div>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Housing Target & Delivery: Ambition vs Reality?</h2>
    <p>Dartford sets a housing target slightly above the government's minimum calculation and significantly higher than its past sluggish delivery rates. This ambition is welcome given the housing crisis. However, the plan needs to robustly deliver this increased number, not just state it.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual Target:</strong> 790 dwellings per year (dpa), totalling 12,640 over the plan period 2021-2037 (Policy S4.2).</li>
        <li><strong>Compared to Need:</strong> This is higher than the standard method calculation of 750 dpa (para 2.60), indicating a willingness to go beyond the minimum.</li>
        <li><strong>Compared to Past Delivery:</strong> Represents a <strong>32% increase</strong> on the historic average of ~600 dpa (para 2.50, 2.63). This is a significant step-up requiring sustained performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Constraints Impact:</strong> The target isn't explicitly lowered due to Green Belt; instead, the *strategy* focuses growth away from it onto brownfield sites (Policy S1, S4.3 targeting 80% on brownfield).</li>
        <li><strong>Land Supply:</strong> On paper, the plan identifies enough land (11,900 homes 2022/23-2036/37 vs 11,850 target for that period - Table 2, p. 52). The key risk is *actual* delivery from complex sites matching the trajectory (Appendix D).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Spatial Strategy: Right Homes, Right Places?</h2>
    <p>The plan rightly concentrates new homes in the urban north, focusing on regenerating Central Dartford and building out the Ebbsfleet Garden City. This protects the Green Belt but places immense pressure on these key areas to deliver.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Priority Locations:</strong> Central Dartford and Ebbsfleet Garden City are the 'overriding priority' (Policy S1.3).</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Focus:</strong> Development is directed to brownfield land outside the Green Belt, primarily north of the A2 (Policy S1.2a, S1.7). 80% brownfield target (Policy S4.3).</li>
        <li><strong>Rural Protection:</strong> Strong protection for Green Belt (Policy S1.10, M12) and limits on village growth (Policy S1.11).</li>
        <li><strong>Underutilised Areas?:</strong> Swanscombe Peninsula is noted as complex (SSSI, past resort proposal) but Policy E6 provides a framework *if* major development doesn't proceed – potentially slow unlock.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Hidden Constraints & Policy Blockers: Reading Between the Lines</h2>
    <p>While the strategic direction is positive, standard Development Management policies contain familiar 'blocker' language around character, design, and amenity. Specific rules on garden land and conversions could unnecessarily restrict supply, especially from smaller sites.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design & Character:</strong> Policy M1 ('Good Design') requires development to 'respond to, reinforce and enhance positive aspects' and 'respect' character. Policy D2 and E2 use similar terms for Dartford/Ebbsfleet. While standard, <strong>this subjectivity can block viable schemes</strong>. Areas of Special Character (para 5.15) need watching.</li>
        <li><strong>Density/Height:</strong> No explicit caps found, but policies require 'appropriate scale' (M1.3, S5.1.vii) and consideration of 'height, mass, form, scale' (M1.2). Design Codes (para 3.33, 5.14) could introduce implicit limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Garden Land/Conversions:</strong> Policy M10.2 resists 'unacceptable loss of residential garden land'. <strong>Policy M10.4 restricts conversions</strong> of houses under 120sqm and generally resists converting terraced houses. This directly limits intensification and smaller homes.</li>
        <li><strong>Discretionary Language:</strong> Frequent use of 'appropriate', 'where possible', 'sympathetic', 'respect' provides wiggle room for refusal based on subjective interpretation.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        "Development which results in an unacceptable loss of residential garden land will be refused."
        <cite>Policy M10, Criterion 2</cite>
      </div>
      <div class="callout">
        "The conversion of a single dwelling house of 120sqm or less... will not be permitted unless... The conversion of terraced houses will not be permitted unless demonstrated to result in beneficial outcomes..."
        <cite>Policy M10, Criterion 4</cite>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Contradictions & Trade-offs: Balancing Acts</h2>
    <p>The plan balances ambitious growth targets against strong environmental and heritage protection. The core trade-off – concentrating development in the urban north to protect the Green Belt south – is relatively clear. However, tensions remain, particularly around delivering sustainable transport to match new development in a car-dependent borough.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth vs Constraints:</strong> High housing target (790 dpa) alongside very strong Green Belt protection (Policy M12) and emphasis on heritage (M5/M6) and SSSIs (E1.3, M14) creates inherent tension.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport:</strong> The plan acknowledges high car dependency (para 1.19) and aims for modal shift (S3.2, M16). However, achieving this alongside major growth will require significant, timely infrastructure investment (S2) and robust travel planning (M15/M16).</li>
        <li><strong>Absolute Constraints?:</strong> Green Belt is treated as near-absolute, in line with national policy. SSSI and Flood Risk are also significant constraints (M14, M4).</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The North/South spatial strategy is a clear trade-off. Balancing competing demands within Development Management policies is less transparent and depends on decision-making.</li>
      </ul>
        <div class="callout">
        "In terms of how residents travel to work, the 2021 Census shows relatively high levels of private vehicle use (46% in total)... The A282/ M25 Dartford Crossing and the arterial A2 London-Dover routes generate high volumes of traffic flow..."
        <cite>Paragraphs 1.19 & 1.18</cite>
      </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Site Allocations: Delivering the Numbers?</h2>
    <p>The plan relies heavily on a few very large, complex regeneration sites, particularly within Ebbsfleet Garden City and Central Dartford. While the SHLAA suggests capacity exists, the delivery risk associated with these major projects is high.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Sites:</strong> Ebbsfleet Garden City (Castle Hill, Ebbsfleet Green, Alkerden, Ashmere - Policy E5, Table 6 suggesting ~7,200 homes in plan period 22/23-36/37) plus Ebbsfleet Central (Policy E4, ~2,000 homes). Central Dartford allocations (D4-D7, Table 4 indicating ~2,200 potential homes).</li>
        <li><strong>Viability/Deliverability:</strong> Assumed based on SHLAA assessment (para 2.65). However, large brownfield regeneration projects are inherently complex and market-dependent.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Sites Role:</strong> Policy S5 allocates 3 specific housing sites (~1,070 homes total). Appendix A lists many smaller potential sites. Table 2 suggests ~800 homes expected from non-allocated/small sites over 15 years. The focus is clearly strategic.</li>
      </ul>
       <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Area</th><th>Indicative Homes (Plan Period 22/23-36/37)</th><th>Key Policies</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Ebbsfleet Garden City (excl. Central)</td><td>~7,200</td><td>E1, E2, E5, E6, Table 6</td><td>Largest contributor, includes complex sites.</td></tr>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Trajectory & Delivery: Will it Actually Happen?</h2>
    <p>The housing trajectory (Appendix D) averages out to meet the target, but relies on high peaks of delivery, particularly from Ebbsfleet. Significant delivery is dependent on major sites starting or continuing later in the plan period, increasing the risk of under-delivery if they stall.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile:</strong> The trajectory graph (p. 239) shows large peaks (esp. year 4/2024-25 at ~1450 homes) and troughs, averaging 790 dpa over the full period.</li>
        <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Relies on continuous, large-scale build-out from complex regeneration sites. Low reliance on windfall (para 2.66).</li>
        <li><strong>Backloading:</strong> Major components like Ebbsfleet Central (para 4.38 suggests start in 2030s), Priory Centre (D6), and Station Surrounds (D7) are expected mid-plan or later, or extend beyond 2037.</li>
        <li><strong>Shortfall Risk:</strong> While no *planned* shortfall, the reliance on complex sites and ambitious peaks creates a significant risk of *actual* delivery falling short if market conditions worsen or sites face delays. Monitoring triggers exist (Table 14).</li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Policy Language & Implementation: Certainty or Chaos?</h2>
    <p>The plan provides locational certainty through its focused spatial strategy and site allocations. However, the Development Management policies use standard discretionary language, creating implementation risks where subjective judgements on design, character, or amenity can slow or block development.</p>
    <div class="evidence">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Certainty Provided:</strong> Clear focus on Central Dartford & Ebbsfleet (S1, D1, E1). Specific site allocations (D4-D7, E4-E6, S5, M11, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Discretion Remains:</strong> Policies M1 (Design), M2 (Amenity), M5/M6 (Heritage), M10 (Extensions) contain criteria requiring interpretation ('appropriate', 'significant harm', 'respect character', 'unacceptable loss').</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment vs Leeway:</strong> Decision-makers have the usual leeway inherent in interpreting planning policies. Proactive, pro-delivery implementation will be crucial.</li>
      </ul>
