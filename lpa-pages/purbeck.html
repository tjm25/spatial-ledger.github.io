    <h1>Spatial Ledger Analysis: Purbeck Local Plan (2018-2034, Adopted 2024)</h1>

    <div class="summary-box">
        This Local Plan meets its modest housing target on paper but fails to address the scale of Purbeck's affordability crisis, relying heavily on complex environmental mitigation and potentially restrictive policies that risk stifling delivery.
    </div>

    <div class="metric-flags-container">
        <div class="flag amber">Target vs Need: Bare Minimum</div>
        <div class="flag amber">Spatial Strategy: Dispersed Risk</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="target-delivery">
        <h2>Housing Target: Meeting the Minimum, Missing the Crisis</h2>
        <p>The Plan sets a target of 186 homes per year (2,976 total). While this figure technically meets the government's 'standard method' calculation *after* applying a cap, it seems insufficient given Purbeck's severe affordability problems. The Plan itself notes a lower quartile affordability ratio of 11.1 and identifies a need for 149 affordable homes per year – meaning affordable homes alone make up 80% of the *entire* target. This suggests the overall target is constrained and won't meaningfully tackle the affordability crisis.</p>
        <p>Positively, the Council acknowledged constraints meant it couldn't meet need without Green Belt release, which it undertook at Lytchett Matravers and Upton after neighbours confirmed they couldn't help. However, the overall low number across 16 years in a high-pressure area remains a concern.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Policy H1 (Target: 186/yr, 2,976 total); Para 131 (Standard method with cap); Para 187 (Affordability ratio 11.1); Para 188 (Affordable need 149/yr); Para 132, 51-53 (Green Belt release necessity).
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Affordability Gap:</strong> An affordable housing need of 149 homes/year versus a total target of 186 homes/year highlights a fundamental mismatch between what the plan aims to deliver and what's needed locally.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="spatial-strategy">
        <h2>Spatial Strategy: Spreading Thin?</h2>
        <p>The strategy aims to 'spread' development, focusing the largest allocations (around 1,000 homes plus extra care) on the "less constrained" western sites of Wool and Moreton Station/Redbridge Pit. It also allocates ~240 homes on released Green Belt land nearer the Poole conurbation (Lytchett Matravers and Upton). Significant contributions are also expected from Neighbourhood Plans (Wareham, Bere Regis) and small sites/windfall.</p>
        <p>While utilising rail links at Wool and Moreton is positive, concentrating major growth further west may increase car dependency for commuting towards the main employment hub around Poole/Bournemouth. The significant reliance (over 1,000 homes) on small sites (Policy H8) and windfall adds delivery uncertainty and risks inefficient, scattered development patterns, despite limits based on settlement size.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Policy V1, Policy H2 (Supply Breakdown); Para 46, 134 (Strategy explanation); Policies H4-H7 (Allocations); Policy H8 (Small sites criteria); Appendix 2 (Small sites list); Para 138, 139 (Reliance on small sites/windfall).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="policy-blockers">
        <h2>Policy Blockers: Death by a Thousand Cuts?</h2>
        <p>While the plan allocates sites, numerous policies introduce significant subjective hurdles. Landscape (E1), Historic Environment (E2), and Design (E12) policies use strong protective language ("great weight", "conserve and enhance") and rely on subjective judgements about "significance", "character", and "positive integration". Policy E12(h) explicitly links efficient land use to "the local area's prevailing character", potentially blocking appropriate densification.</p>
        <p>The plan <strong class="highlight">rejects specific density standards</strong> (Para 166), relying instead on vague "optimisation" and "responding to density", risking under-development of precious land. Furthermore, the much-vaunted Second Homes policy (H14) contains exemptions for commercial holiday lets and 1-for-1 replacements, potentially making it <strong class="highlight">more performative than impactful</strong> in securing homes for local residents.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Policy E1 (Landscape); Policy E2 (Heritage); Policy E12 (Design - esp. (h)); Para 166 (Density rejection); Policy H14 & Paras 206-212 (Second Homes).
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Quote:</strong> "Development proposals should respond to the density of the surrounding area." (Para 166) - Risks locking in low densities.
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Quote:</strong> Policy E12 requires design that "positively integrates with their surroundings" and "reflects the diverse but localised traditions of building materials". - Subjective criteria open to abuse.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="contradictions">
        <h2>Contradictions & Trade-offs: Environment vs Homes</h2>
        <p>The plan is dominated by the tension between Purbeck's high-quality environment (AONB, Heathlands, Coast, Heritage) and housing need. Stringent requirements for Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) are evident, leading to complex and potentially costly mitigation for heathlands (SANGs) and Poole Harbour (nutrient neutrality).</p>
        <p>While the plan *did* make the difficult trade-off of releasing Green Belt land, the overall balance appears heavily weighted towards environmental protection over meeting housing need, particularly affordable need. The complexity of SANG delivery (Policy I5, H4-H6) and nutrient neutrality (Policy E9) adds significant delivery risk and cost, potentially making schemes unviable or slow to come forward.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Paras 31, 32, 55 (Environmental context); Policies E7-E9 (Protected Sites); Policy H3(c)(d), H4(k), H5(k), H6(d), H7(d) (Mitigation requirements); Policy V2 (Green Belt amendment); Policy I5 (Strategic SANG).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="site-assessment">
        <h2>Site Allocations: Deliverable Complexity?</h2>
        <p>The four main strategic sites (Moreton, Wool, Lytchett, Upton) are detailed in Policies H4-H7, alongside Neighbourhood Plan sites and potential small sites (Appendix 2). Policy H2 shows these allocated sites (excluding NP sites) aim to deliver ~1440 homes (+130 extra care). This leaves a very large portion (~1400 homes) reliant on Neighbourhood Plans, small sites (Policy H8), windfall, and exception sites.</p>
        <p>The allocated sites come with significant requirements (SANGs, extra care units, retail space, specific transport upgrades - see H3, H4-H7), adding complexity and potential viability hurdles. The heavy reliance on windfall (~37 homes/year) and small sites (<30 homes each) across numerous settlements introduces substantial delivery risk compared to focusing on fewer, larger, strategically managed sites.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Policy H2 (Supply breakdown); Policies H3-H7 (Site requirements); Policy H8 & Appendix 2 (Small sites); Policy H12 (Exception sites).
        </div>
    </div>

     <div class="section" id="trajectory">
        <h2>Delivery Trajectory: Peaky and Reliant</h2>
        <p>The housing trajectory (p.66) shows delivery peaking mid-plan (around 2026-2028) as the main allocated sites come through, followed by a decline. It relies heavily on consistent delivery from windfall and small sites throughout the period to meet the annual target. While the plan includes a small delivery buffer (3,150 supply vs 2,976 target), any delays in bringing forward the major complex sites or a shortfall in windfall/small sites could jeopardise even the modest overall target.</p>
        <p>Crucially, the trajectory masks the <strong class="highlight">catastrophic shortfall in affordable housing</strong>. Even if the total target is met, delivering only 30-40% affordable homes (as viability suggests) would provide roughly 1,000-1,200 affordable units against a need identified as 2,384 over the plan period.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Housing Trajectory Graph (p.66); Policy H2 (Supply vs Target); Para 188 (Affordable need vs viability).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="implementation-risk">
        <h2>Implementation Risk: Words Matter</h2>
        <p>The plan contains significant implementation risk due to its reliance on subjective policy language. Policies concerning landscape (E1), heritage (E2), and especially design (E12) give considerable interpretive leeway to decision-makers. Terms like "great weight", "harm", "prevailing character", and "integrate positively" lack objective measures and can be used to block or delay development that otherwise complies with the plan's strategy and numerical targets.</p>
        <p>While allocating sites provides some certainty, the overlay of these discretionary policies, coupled with the complexities of delivering required mitigation (SANGs, nutrients), means permissions are far from guaranteed, potentially undermining the plan's ability to meet its own targets.</p>
        <div class="evidence">
            <strong>Evidence:</strong> Policy E1, E2, E12 (Subjective language); Policy H8(b) (Harm assessment); Policy H12(c) (Harm assessment).
