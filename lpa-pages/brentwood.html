  <h1>Spatial Ledger Analysis: Brentwood Local Plan (2016-2033)</h1>
  <p><em>Adopted March 2022</em></p>

  <div class="summary-box">
    <h2>Overall Verdict</h2>
    <p class="summary-verdict">HINDERING: This Local Plan knowingly adopts an insufficient housing target due to Green Belt constraints, kicking the can down the road with an immediate review requirement, while relying on risky, back-loaded delivery from a single large site.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="metric-flags">
    <div class="flag flag-red">Target vs Need: Fails OAN</div>
    <div class="flag flag-amber">Spatial Strategy: Corridor Focus (but huge GB release)</div>

  </div>

  <div class="section" id="target-delivery">
    <h3><span style="color: #dc143c;">Housing Target & Delivery: Planning for Shortfall?</span></h3>
    <p>The Plan sets a target of <strong>7,752 new homes</strong> over the period (2016-2033), averaging 456 dwellings per annum (dpa). This figure is based on an uplift from the Standard Method / SHMA figure (350/380 dpa) <span class="policy-ref">(Fig 4.1, Policy MG01)</span>. However, the Plan explicitly states this is <strong>NOT ENOUGH</strong> to meet the full Objectively Assessed Need (OAN).</p>
    <p>Policy MG06 <span class="policy-ref">(p.52)</span> commits the Council to an <strong>immediate partial review</strong> upon adoption, specifically to meet the full OAN and conduct an updated Green Belt review. This is a stark admission that the adopted plan is already out of date and fails its primary purpose of meeting housing need. While higher than the bare minimum standard method, the target appears constrained by the desire to limit Green Belt release (despite 89% Green Belt coverage forcing significant releases anyway).</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Callout:</strong> "The Council will bring forward a partial update of the Plan with the objective of meeting the full Objectively Assessed Housing Needs. The review will commence immediately upon the adoption of this Plan..." <span class="policy-ref">(Policy MG06)</span> - An admission of failure baked into the adoption document.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="spatial-strategy">
    <h3><span style="color: #ff8c00;">Spatial Strategy: Corridor Focus, Green Belt Sacrifice</span></h3>
    <p>The strategy focuses growth along two main transport corridors: Central Brentwood (A12/mainline rail/Elizabeth Line) and South Brentwood (A127/c2c rail) <span class="policy-ref">(Paras 3.13-3.15)</span>. This aligns development with existing infrastructure, which is positive. However, given <strong>89% of the Borough is designated Green Belt</strong> <span class="policy-ref">(Para 2.45)</span>, delivering the (already insufficient) target requires significant Green Belt releases.</p>
    <p>The largest single allocation is the <strong>Dunton Hills Garden Village (Policy R01)</strong>, a major Green Belt release intended to deliver 1,650 homes in the plan period (out of an indicative 4,000 total). While concentrating development can be efficient, this places enormous pressure on one site and requires substantial infrastructure investment. Growth outside these corridors is explicitly limited <span class="policy-ref">(Para 3.16)</span>. The question remains whether urban capacity and brownfield sites <span class="policy-ref">(Policy MG01 prioritises brownfield)</span> have been truly exhausted, or if other policies (density, character) prevent their full potential being realised.</p>
     <div class="callout">
      <strong>Callout:</strong> The plan relies heavily on a new Garden Village on Green Belt land to meet even its constrained target. Is this strategic planning or finding the path of least resistance away from existing settlements?
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="constraints-blockers">
    <h3><span style="color: #dc143c;">Hidden Constraints & Policy Blockers: Death by Discretion?</span></h3>
    <p>While the Plan allocates sites, numerous policies introduce uncertainty and potential blockages:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design & Character:</strong> Strategic Policy BE14 <span class="policy-ref">(p.92)</span> uses vague terms like "respond positively and sympathetically to their context" and "build upon existing strengths," allowing subjective refusals. The emphasis on "Borough of Villages" character <span class="policy-ref">(Vision, p.29)</span> can be weaponised against necessary density.</li>
      <li><strong>Density:</strong> Policy HP03 <span class="policy-ref">(p.110)</span> sets a minimum of 35 dph but allows exceptions where "character of the surrounding area suggests that such densities would be inappropriate," effectively creating a subjective density cap.</li>
      <li><strong>Heritage:</strong> Policy BE16 <span class="policy-ref">(p.98)</span> gives "great weight" to designated assets, standard practice but potentially restrictive when applied rigidly, especially given the number of assets <span class="policy-ref">(Para 5.143)</span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Gardens:</strong> Policy NE07 <span class="policy-ref">(p.176)</span> specifically resists development on garden land, blocking a key source of sustainable infill development.</li>
    </ul>
    These discretionary policies risk undermining the Plan's delivery targets by creating grounds for delay and refusal, even on allocated sites.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="contradictions-tradeoffs">
    <h3><span style="color: #dc143c;">Contradictions & Trade-offs: Green Belt vs Homes</span></h3>
    <p>The central contradiction is the tension between the stated desire to protect the Green Belt (89% coverage) and the acknowledged need for housing (high prices <span class="policy-ref">(Para 2.17)</span>, OAN shortfall). While Green Belt release is deemed necessary ("Exceptional circumstances have been demonstrated..." <span class="policy-ref">(Para 3.13, 3.15)</span>), the Council has adopted a plan *knowing* it doesn't meet the full need, deferring the difficult decisions via Policy MG06.</p>
    <p>This isn't a transparent trade-off; it's an adoption of an inadequate plan with a promise to fix it immediately. This creates uncertainty for residents and developers. Furthermore, goals like protecting "village character" <span class="policy-ref">(Vision, p.29)</span> risk conflicting directly with the need for efficient land use and higher densities (Policy HP03) required to meet needs sustainably.</p>
     <div class="callout">
      <strong>Callout:</strong> Policy MG06 admits the plan fails on housing need *at the point of adoption*. Why adopt a plan known to be insufficient, delaying meeting needs further?
    </div>
  </div>

   <div class="section" id="site-assessment">
    <h3><span style="color: #ff8c00;">Site Assessment: Dunton Hills Takes the Strain</span></h3>
    <p>The Plan relies heavily on a small number of large strategic sites, most notably Dunton Hills Garden Village (R01, 1650 homes in plan period), Land North of Shenfield (R03, 825 homes), and West Horndon Industrial Estate (R02, 580 homes). Many smaller sites contribute, but the scale of Dunton Hills is critical.</p>
    <p>Deliverability concerns arise from the back-loaded nature of these large sites (see Trajectory). Dunton Hills, requiring significant infrastructure and Green Belt release, carries substantial risk. While brownfield sites within the urban area are included <span class="policy-ref">(e.g. R04 Ford HQ, R10/R11/R13/R14 Car Parks, R15 Wates Way)</span>, their combined contribution is much smaller than the single Dunton Hills allocation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="trajectory-delivery">
    <h3><span style="color: #dc143c;">Trajectory & Delivery: A Risky Hockey Stick</span></h3>
    <p>The Housing Trajectory (Appendix 1, p.258) reveals a deeply concerning picture. Delivery starts low and remains below target initially, creating a cumulative deficit (-668 by 2021/22). The Plan then relies on a massive ramp-up in later years.</p>
    <p>Annual delivery rates are projected to jump from ~300-400 dpa to an enormous <strong>984 dpa</strong> between 2030/31 and 2032/33. This "hockey stick" trajectory is highly ambitious and depends almost entirely on Dunton Hills delivering at an unprecedented scale towards the very end of the plan period. The calculated 5-year housing land supply at adoption (5.21 years <span class="policy-ref">(p.258)</span>) uses the 'Liverpool method' to smooth the past deficit, presenting a more favourable picture than the 'Sedgefield method' likely would. This suggests the supply position is fragile and highly sensitive to delays on major sites.</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Callout:</strong> The plan requires delivery to more than *double* in its final years compared to the preceding period. This looks like hope over realistic expectation.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="language-risk">
    <h3><span style="color: #dc143c;">Policy Language & Implementation Risk: Certainty Undermined</span></h3>
    <p>The frequent use of subjective and discretionary language ("appropriate," "sympathetic," "unacceptable impact," "where possible," "unless the character... suggests") in key policies (BE14 Design, HP03 Density, BE16 Heritage) creates significant implementation risk.</p>
    <p>This wording gives decision-makers considerable leeway to resist development based on subjective interpretation, undermining the certainty the planning system should provide. While allocating sites is positive, these caveats mean permissions are far from guaranteed, potentially slowing down delivery and frustrating the plan's (already inadequate) objectives.</p>
